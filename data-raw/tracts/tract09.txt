                      ON SHORTENING THE CHURCH SERVICE.

                                 [Number 9]
     __________________________________________________________________

     There is a growing feeling that the Services of the Church are too
     long; and many persons think it a sound feeling, merely because it
     is a growing one. Let such as have not made up their minds on the
     subject, suffer themselves, before going into the arguments against
     our Services, to be arrested by the following considerations.

     The Services of our Church, as they now stand, are but a very small
     part of the ancient Christian worship; and, though people now-a-days
     think them too long, there can be no doubt that the primitive
     believers would have thought them too short. Now I am far from
     considering this as a conclusive argument in the question; as if the
     primitive believers were right, and people now-a-days wrong; but
     surely others may fairly be called upon not to assume the reverse.
     On such points it is safest to assume nothing, but to take facts as
     we find them; and the facts are these.

     In ancient times Christians understood very literally all that the
     Bible says about prayer. David had said, "Seven time a day do I
     praise thee;" and St. Paul had said, "Pray always." These texts they
     did not feel at liberty to explain away, but complying with them to
     the letter, praised God seven times a day, besides their morning and
     evening prayer. Their hours or devotion were, in the day time, 6, 9,
     12, and 3, which we called the Horae Canonicae; in the night, 9, 12,
     and 3, which were called the Nocturns; and besides these the hour of
     day-break and retiring to bed; not that they set apart these hours
     in the first instance for public worship,-this was impossible; but
     they seem to have aimed at praying with one accord, and at one time,
     even when they could not do so in one place. "The Universal Church,"
     says Bishop Patrick, "anciently observed certain set hours of
     prayer, that all Christians throughout the world might at the same
     time join together to glorify God; and some of them were of opinion,
     that the Angelical Host, being acquainted with those hours, took
     that time to join their prayers and praises with those of the
     Church." The Hymns and Psalms appropriated to these hours were in
     the first instance intended only for private meditation; but
     afterwards, when Religious Societies were formed, and persons who
     had withdrawn from secular business lived together for purposes of
     devotion, chanting was introduced, and they were arranged for
     congregational worship. Throughout the Churches which used the Latin
     tongue, the same Services were adopted with very little variation:
     and in Roman Catholic countries they continue in use, with only a
     few modern interpolations, even to this day.

     The length of these Services will be in some degree understood from
     the fact, that in the course of every week they go through the whole
     book of Psalms. The writer has been told by a distinguished person,
     who was once a Roman Catholic Priest, that the time required for
     their performance averages three hours a day throughout the year.

     The process of transition from this primitive mode of worship to
     that now used in the Church of England, was gradual. Long before the
     abolition of the Latin Service, the ancient hours of worship had
     fallen into disuse; in religious Societies the daily and nightly
     Services had been arranged in groups under the names of Matins and
     Vespers; and those who prayed in private were allows to suit their
     hours of prayer to their convenience, provided only that they went
     through the whole Services each day. Neither is it to be supposed
     that this modified demand was as all generally complied with. Thus
     in the course of time, the views and feelings, with which prayer had
     been regarded by the early Christians, became antiquated; the forms
     remained, but stripped of their original meaning; Services were
     compressed into one, which had been originally distinct; the idea of
     united worship with a view to which identity of time and language
     had been maintained in different nations, was forgotten; the
     identity of time had been abandoned, and the identity of language
     was not thought worth preserving. Conscious of the incongruity of
     primitive forms and modern feelings, our Reformers undertook to
     construct a Service more in accordance with the spirit of their age.
     They adopted the English language; they curtailed the already
     compressed ritual of the early Christians, so arranging it that the
     Psalms should be gone through monthly, instead of weekly; and,
     carrying the spirit of compression still further, they added to the
     Matin Service what had hitherto been wholly distinct from it, the
     Mass Service or Communion.

     Since the Reformation, the same gradual change in the prevailing
     notions of prayer has worked its way silently but generally. The
     Services, as they were left by the Reformers, were, as they had been
     from the first ages, daily Services; they are now weekly Services.
     Are they not in a fair way to become monthly?
