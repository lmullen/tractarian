     __________________________________________________________________

     BEFORE we meet again, we shall have celebrated the feast of St.
     Simon and St. Jude, the Apostles. You will be at your daily work,
     and will not have the opportunity to attend the Service in Church.
     For that reason, it may be as well, you should lay up some good
     thoughts against that day; and such, by GOD'S blessing, I will
     now attempt to give you.

     As you well know, there were twelve Apostles; St. Simon and St. Jude
     were two of them. They preached the Gospel of CHRIST; and they were
     like CHRIST, as far as sinful man may be accounted like the Blessed
     SON of GOD. They were like CHRIST in their deeds and in their
     sufferings. The Gospel for the festival shows us this. They were
     like CHRIST in their works, because CHRIST was a witness of the
     FATHER, and they were witnesses of CHRIST. CHRIST came in the name
     of GOD the Father Almighty; He "came "and spoke," and "did works
     which none other man did." In like manner, the Apostles were sent to
     bear witness of CHRIST, to declare His power, His great mercy, His
     sufferings on the cross for the sins of all men, His willingness to
     save all who come to Him.

     But again, they were like CHRIST in their sufferings. If the "world
     hate you," He says to them, "you know that it hated Me, before it
     hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own;
     but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of
     the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I
     said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they
     have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept
     My saying, they will keep yours also."

     Thus, they were like CHRIST in office. I do not speak of their
     holiness, their faith, and all their other high excellencies, which
     GOD the Holy Ghost gave them I speak now, not of their personal
     graces, but of their office, of preaching, of witnessing CHRIST, of
     suffering for being His servants. Men ought to have listened to
     them, and honoured them; some did; but the many, the world did
     not,---they hated them; they hated them, for their office-sake;
     not because they were Paul, and Peter, and Simon, and Jude, but
     because they bore witness to the SON of GOD, and were chosen to be
     His Ministers.

     Here is a useful lesson for us at this day. The Apostles indeed are
     dead; yet it is quite as possible for men still to hate their
     preaching and to persecute them, as when they were alive. For in one
     sense they are still alive; I mean, they did not leave the world
     without appointing persons to take their place; and these persons
     represent them, and may be considered with reference to us, as if
     they were the Apostles. When a man dies, his son takes his property,
     and represents him; that is, in a manner he still lives in the
     person of his son. Well, this explains how the Apostles may be said
     to be still among us; they did not indeed leave their sons to
     succeed them as Apostles, but they left spiritual sons; they did not
     leave this life, without first solemnly laying their hands on the
     heads of certain of their brethren, and these took their place, and
     represented them after their death.

     But it may be asked, are these spiritual sons of the Apostles still
     alive? no;---all this took place many hundred years ago. These
     sons and heirs of the Apostles died long since. But then they in
     turn did not leave the world without committing their sacred office
     to a fresh set of Ministers, and they in turn to another, and so on
     even to this day. Thus the Apostles had, first, spiritual sons; then
     spiritual grandsons; then great grandsons; and so on, from one age
     to another, down to the present time.

     Again, it many be asked, who are at this time the successors and
     spiritual descendants of the Apostles ? I shall surprise some people
     by the answer I shall give, though it is very clear, and there is no
     doubt about it; THE BISHOPS. They stand in the place of the
     Apostles, as far as the office of ruling is concerned; and, whatever
     we ought to do, had we lived when the Apostles were alive, the same
     ought we to do for the Bishops. He that despiseth them, despiseth
     the Apostles. It is our duty to reverence them for their
     office-sake; they are the shepherds of CHRIST'S flock. If we
     knew them well, we should love them for the many excellent graces
     they possess, for their piety, loving-kindness, and other virtues.
     But we do not know them; yet still, for all this, we may honour them
     as the Ministers of CHRIST, without going so far as to consider
     their private worth; and we may keep to their "fellowship," as we
     should to that of the Apostles. I say, we may all thus honour them
     even without knowing them in private, because of their high office;
     for they have the marks of CHRIST'S presence upon them, in that
     they witness for CHRIST, and suffer for Him, as the Apostles did. I
     will explain to you how this is.

     There is a temptation which comes on many men to honour no one,
     except such as they themselves know, such as have done favour or
     kindness to them personally. Thus sometimes people speak against
     those who are put over them in this world's matters, as the
     King. They say, "What is the King to me? he never did me any good."
     Now, I answer, whether he did or not, is nothing to the purpose. We
     are bound, for CHRIST'S sake, to honour him, because he is
     King, though he lives far from us; and this all well-disposed
     right-minded people do. And so, in just the same way, though for
     much higher reasons, we must honour the Bishop, because he is the
     Bishop ;---for his office-sake;---because he is CHRIST'S
     Minister, stands in the place of the Apostles, is the Shepherd of
     our souls on earth, while CHRIST is away. This is FAITH, to look at
     things not as seen, but as unseen; to be as sure that the Bishop is
     CHRIST'S appointed Representative, as if we actually saw him
     work miracles as St. Peter and St. Paul did, as you may read in the
     book of the Acts of the Apostles.

     But you will say, how do we know this, since we do not see it? I
     repeat, the Bishops are Apostles to us, from their witnessing
     CHRIST, and suffering for Him.

     1. They witness our LORD in their very name, for He is the true
     Bishop of our souls, as St. Peter says, and they are Bishops. They
     witness CHRIST in their station;---there is but One LORD to save
     us, and there is but one Bishop in each place. The meetingers have
     no head, they are all of them mixed together in a confused way; but
     we of CHRIST'S Holy Church (blessed be God!) have one Bishop
     over us, and our Bishop is the Bishop of ------------.
     Many of you have seen him lately, when he confirmed in our Church.
     That very confirmation is another ordinance, in which the Bishop
     witnesses CHRIST. Our LORD and SAVIOUR confirms us with the SPIRIT
     in all goodness; the Bishop is His figure and likeness, when he lays
     his hands on the heads of children. Then CHRIST, (as we trust,)
     comes to them, so confirm in them the grace of Baptism. Moreover,
     the Bishop rules the whole Church here below, as CHRIST, the true
     and eternal Sovereign, rules it above; and here again the Bishop is
     a figure or witness of our LORD. And further, it is the Bishop who
     is commissioned to make us Clergymen GOD'S Ministers. He is
     CHRIST'S instrument; and he visibly chooses those whom CHRIST
     vouchsafes to choose invisibly, to serve in the Word and Sacraments
     of the Church. And thus, in one sense, it is from the Bishop that
     the news of redemption and the means of grace have come to all men;
     this again is a witnessing CHRIST. I, who speak to you concerning
     CHRIST, was ordained to do so by the Bishop; he speaks in
     me,---as CHRIST wrought in him, and as GOD sent CHRIST. Thus the
     whole plan of salvation hangs together.---CHRIST the True
     Mediator above; His servant, the Bishop, His earthly likeness;
     mankind the subjects of His teaching; GOD the Author of Salvation.

     2. But I must now mention the more painful part of the subject, i.
     e. the sufferings of the Bishops, which is the second mark of their
     being our living Apostles. I may say, Bishops have undergone this
     trial in every age. As the first Apostles were hated and op posed by
     the world, so have they ever been. I do not say they have been
     always opposed in the same way. In these latter times, they have
     experienced the lesser sufferings of bearing slander, reproach,
     threats, vexations, and thwartings in their efforts to do good. Time
     was, when they were even persecuted, cruelly slain by fire and
     sword. That time, (though GOD avert it!) may come again. But,
     whether or not Satan is permitted so openly to rage, certainly some
     kinds of persecution are to be expected in our day; nay, such have
     begun. It is not so very long since the great men of the earth told
     them to prepare for persecution; it is not so very long since the
     mad people answered the summons, and furiously attacked them, and
     seemed bent on destroying them, in all parts of the country.

     Yes! the day may come, even in this generation, when the
     Representatives of CHRIST are spoiled of their sacred possessions,
     and degraded from their civil dignities. The day may come, when each
     of us inferior Ministers---when I myself, whom you know---may
     have to give up our Churches, and be among you, in no better
     temporal circumstances than yourselves; with no larger dwelling, no
     finer clothing, no other fare, with nothing different beyond those
     gifts, which I trust we received from the All-gracious GOD when we
     were made Ministers; and those again, which have been vouchsafed to
     us before and after that time, for the due fulfilment of our
     Ministry. Then you will look at us, not as gentlemen, as now; not as
     your superiors in worldly station; but still, nay, more strikingly
     so than now, still as messengers from Him, who seeth and worketh in
     secret, and who judgeth not by outward appearance. Then you will
     honour us, with a purer honour than many men do now, namely, as
     those (if I may say so) who are intrusted with the keys of heaven
     and hell, as the heralds of mercy, as the denouncers of woe to
     wicked men, as intrusted with the awful and mysterious privilege of
     dispensing CHRIST'S Body and Blood, as far greater than the
     most powerful and the wealthiest of men in our unseen strength and
     our heavenly riches. This may all come in our day; we must do our
     duty; go straight forward, looking neither to the right hand nor the
     left, " in patience possessing our souls," watching and praying, and
     so preparing for the evil day. And after all, if GOD'S loving
     kindness spares both us and you the trial, still it will have been
     useful to have steadily thought about it beforehand, and to have
     prepared our hearts to meet it.
