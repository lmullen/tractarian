                                  LETTER I.

     You wish to have my opinion on the doctrine of "the Holy Catholic
     Church," as contained in Scripture, and taught in the Creed. So I
     send you the following lines, which perhaps may serve, through
     GOD'S blessing, to assist you in your search after the truth in
     this matter, even though they do no more; indeed no remarks, however
     just, can be much more than an assistance to you. You must search
     for yourself, and GOD must teach you.

     I think I partly enter into your present perplexity. You argue, that
     true doctrine is the important matter for which we must contend, and
     a right state of the affections is the test of vital religion in the
     heart: and you ask, " Why may I not be satisfied if my Creed is
     correct, and my affections spiritual? Have I not in that case enough
     to evidence a renewed mind, and to constitute a basis of union with
     others like minded? The love of CHRIST is surely the one and only
     requisite for Christian communion here, and the joys of heaven
     hereafter." Again you say, that------and------are
     constant in their prayers for the teaching of the HOLY SPIRIT; so
     that if it be true, that every one who asketh receiveth, surely they
     must receive, and are in a safe state.

     Believe me, I do not think lightly of these arguments. They are very
     subtle ones; powerfully influencing the imagination, and difficult
     to answer. Still I believe them to be mere fallacies. Let me try
     them in a parallel case. You know the preacher at---------,
     and have heard of his flagrantly immoral life; yet it is notorious
     that he can and does speak in a moving way of the love of CHRIST,
     &c. It is very shocking to witness such a case, which (we will hope)
     is rare; but it has its use. Do you not think him in peril, in spite
     of his impressive and persuasive language? Why?---You will say,
     his life is bad. True; it seems then that more is requisite for
     salvation than an orthodox creed, and keen sensibility; viz.
     consistent conduct.---Very well then, we have come to an
     additional test of true faith, obedience to GOD'S word, and
     plainly a scriptural test, according to St. John's canon, "He
     who doeth righteousness is righteous." Do not you see then your
     argument is already proved to be unsound? It seems that true
     doctrine and warm feelings are not enough. How am I to know what is
     enough? you ask. I reply, by searching Scripture. It was your
     original fault that, instead of inquiring what GOD has told you is
     necessary for being a true Christian, you chose out of your own head
     to argue on the subject;---e. g. "I can never believe that to be
     such and such is not enough for salvation," &c. Now this is worldly
     wisdom.

     Let us join issue then on this plain ground, whether or not the
     doctrine of "the Church," and the duty of obeying it, be laid down
     in Scripture. If so, it is no matter as regards our practice,
     whether the doctrine is primary or secondary, whether the duty is
     much or little insisted on. A Christian mind will aim at obeying the
     whole counsel and will of GOD; on the other hand, to those who are
     tempted arbitrarily to classify and select their duties, it is
     written, "Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments, and
     shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of
     heaven."

     And here first, that you may clearly understand the ground I am
     taking, pray observe that I am not attempting to controvert any one
     of those high evangelical points, on which perhaps we do not
     altogether agree with each other. Perhaps you attribute less
     efficacy to the Sacrament of Baptism than I do; bring out into
     greater system and prominence the history of an individual's
     war fare with his spiritual enemies; fix more precisely and abruptly
     the date of his actual conversion from darkness to light; and
     consider that Divine Grace acts more arbitrarily against the corrupt
     human will, than I think is revealed in Scripture. Still, in spite
     of this difference of opinion, I see no reason why you should not
     accept heartily the Scripture doctrine of " the Church." And this is
     the point I wish to press, not asking you at present to abandon your
     own opinions, but to add to them a practical belief in a tenet which
     the Creed teaches and Scripture has consecrated. And this surely is
     quite possible. The excellent Mr. ------, of ------,who
     has lately left ---------, was both a Calvinist, and a
     strenuous High-Churchman.

     You are in the practice of distinguishing between the Visible and
     Invisible Church. Of course I have no wish to maintain, that those
     who shall be saved hereafter are exactly the same company that are
     under the means of grace here; still I must insist on it, that
     Scripture makes the existence of a Visible Church a condition of the
     existence of the Invisible. I mean, the Sacraments are evidently in
     the hands of the Church Visible; and these, we know, are generally
     necessary to salvation, as the Catechism says. Thus it is an
     undeniable fact, as true as that souls will be saved, that a Visible
     Church must exist as a means towards that end. The Sacraments are in
     the hands of the Clergy; this few will deny, or that their efficacy
     is independent of the personal character of the administrator. What
     then shall be thought of any attempts to weaken or exterminate that
     Community? or that Ministry, which is an appointed condition of the
     salvation of the elect? But every one, who makes or encourages a
     schism, must weaken it. Thus it is plain, schism must be wrong in
     itself, even if Scripture did not in express terms forbid it, as it
     does.

     But further than this; it is plain this Visible Church is a standing
     body. Every one who is baptized, is baptized into an existing
     community. Our Service expresses this when it speaks of baptized
     infants being incorporated into GOD'S holy Church. Thus the
     Visible Church is not a voluntary association of the day, but a
     continuation of one which existed in the age before us, and then
     again in the age before that; and so back till we come to the age of
     the Apostles. In the same sense, in which Corporations of the
     State's creating, are perpetual, is this which CHRIST has
     founded. This is a matter of fact hitherto; and it necessarily will
     be so always, for is not the notion absurd of an unbaptized person
     baptizing others? which is the only way in which the Christian
     community can have a new beginning.

     Moreover Scripture directly insists upon the doctrine of the Visible
     Church as being of importance. E. g. St. Paul says;--- "There is
     one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your
     calling; one LORD, one faith, one baptism, one GOD and Father of
     all." Ephes. iv. 5, 6. Thus, as far as the Apostle's words go,
     it is as false and unchristian, (I do not mean in degree of guilt,
     but in its intrinsic sinfulness,) to make more bodies than one, as
     to have many Lords, many Gods, many Creeds. Now, I wish to know, how
     it is possible for any one to fall into this sin, if Dissenters are
     clear of it? What is the sin, if separation from the Existing Church
     is not it?

     I have shown that there is a divinely instituted Visible Church, and
     that it has been one and the same by successive incorporation of
     members from the beginning. Now I observe further, that the word
     Church, as used in Scripture, ordinarily means this actually
     existing visible body. The possible exception to this rule, out of
     about 100 places in the New Testament, where the word occurs, are
     four passages in the Epistle to the Ephesians; two in the
     Colossians; and one in the Hebrews. (Eph. i. 22; iii. 10. 2 l; v.
     23---82. Col. i. 18. 24. Heb. xii. 23.) And in some of these
     exceptions the sense is at most but doubtful. Further, our SAVIOUR
     uses the word twice, and in both times of the Visible Church. They
     are remarkable passages, and may here be introduced, in continuation
     of my argument.

     Matt. xvi. 18. "Upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates
     of hell shall not prevail against it." Now I am certain, any
     unprejudiced mind, who knew nothing of controversy, considering the
     Greek word [ekklesia] means simply an assembly, would have no doubt
     at all that it meant in this passage a visible body. What right have
     we to disturb the plain sense? why do we impose a meaning, arising
     from some system of our own? And this view is altogether confirmed
     by the other occasion of our LORD'S using it, where it can only
     denote the Visible Church. Matt. xviii. 17. "If he (thy brother)
     shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church; but if he
     neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man
     and a publican."

     Observe then what we gain by these two passages;---the grant of
     power to the Church; and the promise of permanence. Now look at the
     fact. The body then begun has continued; and has always claimed and
     exercised the power of a corporation or society. Consider merely the
     article in the Creed, " The Holy Catholic Church;" which embodies
     this notion. Do not Scripture and History illustrate each other?

     I end this first draught of my argument, with the text in 1 Tim.
     iii. 15, in which St. Paul calls the Church "the pillar and ground
     of the truth,"---which can refer to nothing but a Visible Body;
     else martyrs may be invisible, and preachers, and teachers, and the
     whole order of the Ministry.

     My paper is exhausted. If you allow me, I will send you soon a
     second Letter; meanwhile I sum up what I have been proving from
     Scripture thus; that ALMIGHTY GOD might have left Christianity as a
     sort of sacred literature, as contained in the Bible, which each
     person was to take and use by himself; just as we read the works of
     any human philosopher or historian, from which we gain practical
     instruction, but the knowledge of which does not bind us to be
     Newtonians, or Aristotelians, &c., or to go out of our line of life
     in consequence of it. This, I say, He might have done; but, in
     matter of fact, He has ordained otherwise. He has actually set up a
     Society, which exists even this day all over the world, and which
     (as a general rule) Christians are bound to join; so that to believe
     in CHRIST is not a mere opinion or a secret conviction, but a social
     or even a political principle, forcing one into what is often
     stigmatized as party strife, and quite inconsistent with the
     supercilious mood of those professed Christians of the day, who
     stand aloof, and designate their indifference as philosophy.
       _______________________________________________________________

                                  LETTER II.

     I AM sometimes struck with the inconsistency of those, who do not
     allow us to express the gratitude due to the Church, while they do
     not hesitate to declare their obligation to individuals who have
     benefited them. To a vow that they owe their views of religion and
     their present hopes of salvation to this or that distinguished
     preacher, appears to them as harmless, as it may be in itself true
     and becoming; but if a person ascribes his faith and knowledge to
     the Church, he is thought to forget his peculiar and unspeakable
     debt to that SAVIOUR who died for him. Surely, if our LORD makes man
     His instrument of good to man, and if it is possible to be grateful
     to man without forgetting the Source of all grace and power, there
     is nothing wonderful in His having appointed a company of men as the
     especial medium of His instruction and spiritual gifts, and in
     consequence, of His having laid upon us the duty of gratitude to it.
     Now this is all I wish to maintain, what is most clearly (as I
     think) revealed in Scripture, that the blessings of redemption come
     to us through the Visible Church; so that, as we betake ourselves to
     a Dispensary for medicine, without attributing praise or intrinsic
     worth to the building or the immediate managers of its stores, in
     something of the like manner we are to come to that One Society, to
     which CHRIST has entrusted the office of stewardship in the
     distribution of gifts, of which He alone is the Author and real
     Dispenser.

     In the letter I sent you the other day, I made some general remarks
     on this doctrine; now let me continue the subject.

     First, the Sacraments, which are the ordinary means of grace, are
     clearly in possession of the Church. Baptism is an incorporation
     into a body; and invests with spiritual blessings, because it is the
     introduction into a body so invested. In 1 Cor. xii. we are taught
     first, the SPIRIT'S indwelling in the Visible Church or body; I
     do not say in every member of it, but generally in it;---next, we
     are told that the SPIRIT baptizes individuals into that body. Again,
     the LORD'S Supper carries evidence of its social nature even in
     its name: it is not a solitary individual act, it is a joint
     communion. Surely nothing is more alien to Christianity than the
     spirit of Independence; the peculiar Christian blessing, i. e. the
     presence of CHRIST, is upon two or three gathered together, not on
     mere individuals.

     But this is not all. The Sacraments are committed, not into the
     hands of the Church Visible assembled together, (though even this
     would be no unimportant doctrine practically,) but into certain
     definite persons, who are selected from their brethren for that
     trust. I will not here determine who these are in each successive
     age, but will only point out how far this principle itself will
     carry us. The doctrine is implied in the original institution of the
     LORD'S Supper, where CHRIST says to His Apostles, "Do this."
     Further, take that remarkable passage in Matt. xxiv. 45---51.
     Luke xii. 42---46, "Who then is that faithful and wise Steward,
     whom his Lord shall make ruler over His household, to give them
     their portion of meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom
     his Lord, when He cometh, shall find so doing!" &c. Now I do not
     inquire who in every age are the stewards spoken of, (though in my
     own mind I cannot doubt the line of Bishops is that Ministry, and
     consider the concluding verses fearfully prophetic of the Papal
     misuse of the gift;---by the bye, at least it shows this, that
     bad men may nevertheless be the channels of grace to GOD'S
     "household,") I do not ask who are the stewards, but surely the
     words, when He cometh, imply that they are to continue till the end
     of the world. This reference is abundantly confirmed by our
     LORD'S parting words to the eleven; in which, after giving them
     the baptismal commission, He adds, "Lo! I am with you always, even
     unto the end of the world." If then He was with the Apostles in a
     way in which He was not present with teachers who were strangers to
     their "fellowship," (Acts ii. 42.) which all will admit, so, in like
     manner, it cannot be a matter of indifference in any age, what
     teachers and fellowship a Christian selects; there must be those
     with whom CHRIST is present, who are His " Stewards," and whom it is
     our duty to obey.

     As I have mentioned the question of faithfulness and unfaithfulness
     in Ministers, I may refer to the passage in 1 Cor. iv. where St.
     Paul, after speaking of himself and others as "Stewards of the
     mysteries of God," and noticing that "it is required of Stewards,
     that a man be found faithful," adds, "With me it is a very small
     thing that I should be judged of you or of man's judgment ....
     therefore judge nothing before the time."

     To proceed, consider the following passage: "Obey them that have
     rule over you, and submit yourselves." Heb. xiii. 17. Again, I do
     not ask who these are; but whether this is not a duty, however it is
     to be fulfilled, which multitudes in no sense fulfil. Consider the
     number of people, professing and doubtless in a manner really
     actuated by Christian principle, who yet wander about from church to
     church, or from church to meeting, as sheep without a shepherd, or
     who choose a preacher merely because he pleases their taste, and
     whose first movement towards any clergyman they meet, is to examine
     and criticize his doctrine: what conceivable meaning do they put
     upon these words of the Apostle? Does any one rule over them? do
     they in any way submit themselves? Can these persons excuse their
     conduct, except on the deplorably profane plea, (which yet I believe
     is in their hearts at the bottom of their disobedience,) that it
     matters little to keep CHRIST'S "least commandments," so that
     we embrace the peculiar doctrines of His gospel?

     Some time ago I drew up a sketch of the Scripture proof of the
     doctrine of the Visible Church; which with your leave I will here
     transcribe. You will observe, I am not arguing for this or that form
     of Polity, or for the Apostolical Succession, but simply the duties
     of order, union, ecclesiastical gifts, and ecclesiastical obedience;
     I limit myself to these points, as being persuaded that, when they
     are granted, the others will eventually follow.

     I. That there was a Visible Church in the Apostles' day.

     1. General texts. Matt. xvi. 18; xviii. 17. 1 Tim. iii. 15. Acts
     passim, &c.

     2. Organization of the Church.

     (1.) Diversity of ranks. 1 Cor. xii. Eph. iv. 4---12. Rom. xii.
     4---8. 1 Pet. iv. 10, 11.

     (2.) Governors. Matt. xxviii. 19. Mark xvi. 15, 16. John xx. 22, 23.
     Luke xxii. 19, 20. Gal. ii. 9, &c.

     (3.) Gifts. Luke xii. 42, 43. John xx. 22, 23. Matt. xviii. 18.

     (4.) Order. Acts viii. 5, 6, 12, 14, l5, 17; xi. 22, 23; xi. 2,4;
     ix.27; xv.2, 4, 6, 25, xvi. 4; xviii. 22; xxi. 17---19. conf.
     Gal. i. 1, 12. 1 Cor. xiv. 40. 1 Thess. v. 14.

     (5.) Ordination. Acts vi. 6. 1 Tim. iv. 14; v. 22. 2 Tim. i. 6. Tit.
     i. 5. Acts xiii. 3. conf. Gal. i. 1,

     (6.) Ecclesiastical obedience. 1 Thess. v. 12, 13. Heb. xiii. 17. 1
     Tim. v. 17.

     (7.) Rules and discipline. Matt. xxviii. 19. Matt. xviii. 17. 1 Cor.
     v. 4---7. Gal. v. 12, &c. 1 Cor. xvi. 1, 2. 1 Cor. xi. 2, 16, &c.

     (8.) Unity. Rom. xvi. 17. 1 Cor. i. 10; iii. 3; xiv. 26. Col. ii. 5.
     1 Thess. v. 14. 2 Thess. iii. 6.

     II. That the Visible Church, thus instituted by the Apostles, was
     intended to continue.

     1. Why should it not? The onus probandi lies with those who deny
     this position. If the doctrines and precepts already cited are
     obsolete at this day, why should not the following texts? e. g. 1
     Pet. ii. 13, or e. g. Matt. vii. 14. John iii. 3.

     2. Is it likely so elaborate a system should be framed, yet with no
     purpose of its continuing?

     3. The objects to be obtained by it are as necessary now as then.
     (1.) Preservation of the faith. (2.) Purity of doctrine. (3.)
     Edification of Christians. (4.) Unity of operation. Vid. Epists. to
     Tim. & Tit. passim.

     4. If system were necessary in a time of miracles, much more is it
     now.

     5. 2 Tim. ii. 2. Matt. xxviii. 20, &c.

     Take these remarks, as they are meant, as mere suggestions for your
     private consideration.
