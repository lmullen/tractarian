              ON ARGUING CONCERNING THE APOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION.

                                 [Number 19]
     __________________________________________________________________

     Men are sometimes disappointed with the proofs offered in behalf of
     some important doctrines of our religion; such especially as the
     necessity of Episcopal Ordination, in order to constitute a Minister
     of Christ. They consider these proofs to be not so strong as they
     expected, or as they think desirable. Now such persons should be
     asked, whether these arguments they speak of are in their estimation
     weak as a guide to their own practice, or weak in controversy with
     hardheaded and subtle disputants. Surely, as Bishop Butler has
     convincingly shown, the faintest probabilities are strong enough to
     determine our conduct in a matter of duty. If there be but a
     reasonable likelihood of our pleasing Christ more by keeping than by
     not keeping to the fellowship of the Apostolic Ministry, this of
     course ought to be enough to lead those, who think themselves moved
     to undertake the Sacred Office, to seek for a license to do so from
     it.

     It is necessary to keep this truth distinctly in view, because of
     the great temptation, that exists among us, to put it out of sight.
     I do not mean the temptation, which results from pride,-hardness of
     heart,-a profane disregard of the details and lesser commandments of
     the Divine Law,--and other such like bad principles of our nature,
     which are in the way of our honestly confessing it. Besides these,
     there is a still more subtle temptation to slight it, which will
     bear insisting on here, arising from an over-desire to convince
     others, or, in other words a desire to out-argue others, a fear of
     seeming inconclusive and confused in our own nations and arguments.
     Nothing, certainly, is more natural, when we hold a truth strongly,
     than to wish to persuade others to embrace it also. Nay, without
     reference to persuasion, nothing is more natural than to be
     dissatisfied in all cases with our own convictions of a principle or
     opinion, nay suspicious of it, till we are able to set it down
     clearly in words. We know, that, in all matters of thought, to write
     down our meaning is one important means of clearing our minds. Till
     we do so, we often do not know what we really hold and what we do
     not hold. And a cautious and accurate reasoner, when he has
     succeeded in bringing the truth of any subject home to his mind,
     next begins to look round about the view he has adopted, to consider
     what others will say to it, and to try to make it unexceptionable.
     At least we are led thus to fortify our opinion, when it is actually
     attacked; and if we find we cannot recommend it to the judgment of
     the assailant, at any rate we endeavour to make him feel that it is
     to be respected. It is painful to be thought a weak reasoner, even
     though we are sure in our minds that we are not such.

     Now, observe how these feelings will affect us, as regards such
     arguments as were alluded to above; viz. such as are open to
     exception, though they are sufficiently strong to determine our
     conduct. A Friend, who differs from us asks for our reasons for our
     own view. We state them, and he sifts them. He observes, that our
     conclusions do not necessarily flow from our premises. E. g. to take
     the argument for the Apostolical Succession derived from the
     ordination of St. Paul and St. Barnabas (Acts xiii. 2, 3), he will
     argue, that their ordination might have been an accidental rite,
     intended merely to commission them for their Missionary journey,
     which followed it, in Asia Minor; again, that St. Paul's direction
     to Timothy (1 Tim. v. 22), to "lay hands suddenly on no man," may
     refer to confirmation, not ordination.

     We should reply, (and most reasonably, too,) that, considering the
     undeniable fact that ordination has ever been thought necessary in
     the Church for the Ministerial Commission, our interpretation is the
     most probably one, and therefore the safest to act upon; on which
     our friend will think awhile, then shake his head, and say, that "at
     all events this is an unsatisfactory mode of reasoning, that it does
     not convince him, that he is desirous of clearer light," &c.

     Now what is the consequence of such a discussion as this on
     ourselves? not to make us give up the doctrine, but to make us
     afraid of urging it. We grow lukewarm about it; and with an
     appearance of judgment and caution, (as the world will call it,)
     confess that "to rest the claims of our Clergy on an Apostolical
     Descent is an unsafe and inexpedient line of argument; that it will
     not convince men, the evidence not being sufficient; that it is not
     a practical way of acting to insist upon it," &c-whereas the utmost
     that need be admitted is, that it is out of place to make it the
     subject of a speculative dispute, and to argue about it on that
     abstract logical platform which virtually excludes a reference to
     conduct and duty. And indeed, it would be no unwise caution to bear
     about us, wherever we go, that our first business, as Christians, is
     to address men as responsible servants of CHRIST, not as
     antagonists; and that it is but a secondary duty (though a duty) to
     "refute the gainsayers."

     And, as on the one hand it continually happens, that those who are
     most skilled in debate are deficient in sound practical piety, so on
     the other it may be profitable to us to reflect, that doctrine,
     which we believe to be most true, and which are received as such by
     the most profound and enlarged intellects, and which rest upon the
     most irrefragable proofs, yet may be above our disputative powers,
     and can be treated by us only with reference to our conduct. And in
     this way, as in others, is fulfilled the saying of the Apostle, that
     "the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness; but
     unto us who are saved, it is the power of GOD... Where is the wise:?
     where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not
     GOD made foolish the wisdom of this world?... The foolishness of GOD
     is wise than men; and the weakness of GOD is stronger than men."

             ON RELUCTANCE TO CONFESS THE APOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION.

     If a Clergyman is quite convinced that the Apostolical Succession is
     lost, then of course he is at liberty to turn his mind from the
     subject. But if he is not quite sure of this, it surely is his duty
     seriously to examine the question, and to make up his mind carefully
     and deliberately. For if there be a chance of its being preserved to
     us, there is a chance of his having had a momentous talent committed
     to him, which he is burying in the earth.

     It cannot be supposed that any serious man would treat the subject
     scoffingly. If any one is tempted to do so, let him remember the
     tearful words of the Apostle: "Esau, a profane person, who for one
     morsel of meat sold his birthright."

     If any are afraid, that to insist on their commission will bring
     upon them ridicule, and diminish their usefulness, let them ask
     themselves, whether it be not cowardice to refuse top leave the
     event to GOD. It was the reproach of the men of Ephraim that, though
     they were "harnessed and carried bows," they "turned themselves back
     in the day of battle."

     And if any there be, who take upon them to contrast one doctrine of
     the Gospel with another, and preach those only which they consider
     more essential, let them consider our SAVIOUR'S words, "These things
     ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."
