   THE VISIBLE CHURCH.
   LETTERS TO A FRIEND.
   No. III.

   [Number 20]
     __________________________________________________________________

     YOU have some misgivings, it seems, lest the doctrine I have been
     advocating "should lead to Popery." I will not, by way of answer,
     say, that the question is not, whether it will lead to Popery, but
     whether it is in the Bible; because it would bring the Bible and
     Popery into one sentence, and seem to imply the possibility of a
     "communion" between "light and darkness." No; it is the very enmity
     I feel against he Papistical corruptions of the Gospel, which leads
     me to press upon you a doctrine of Scripture, which we are sinfully
     surrendering, and the Church of Rome has faithfully retained.

     How comes it that a system, so unscriptural as the Popish, makes
     converts? because it has in it an element of truth and comfort amid
     its falsehoods. And the true way of opposing it, is, not to give up
     to them that element, which GOD'S providence has preserved to
     us also, thus basely surrendering "the inheritance of our Fathers,"
     but to claim it as our own, and to make use of it for the purposes
     for which GOD has given it to us. I will explain what I mean.

     Before CHRIST came, Divine Truth was, as it were, a pilgrim in the
     world. The Jews excepted, men who had portions of the SPIRIT of GOD,
     knew not their privilege. The whole force and current of the
     external world was against them, acting powerfully on their
     imagination, and tempting them to set sight against faith, to trust
     the many witnesses who prophesied falsehood (as if) in the name of
     the LORD, rather than the still small voice which spoke within them.
     Who can undervalue the power of this fascination, who has had
     experience of the world ever so little? Who can go at this day into
     mixed society, who can engage in politics or other active business,
     and not find himself gradually drifting off from the true Rock on
     which his faith is built, till he begins in despair to fancy, that
     solitude is the only safe place for the Christian, or, (with a baser
     judgment,) that strict obedience will not be required at the last
     day of those who have been engaged in active life? If such is now
     the power of the world's enchantments, surely much greater was
     it before our SAVIOUR came.

     Now what did He do for us, in order to meet this evil? His merciful
     Providence chose means which might act as a counter influence on the
     imagination. The visible power of the world enthralled men to a lie:
     He set up a Visible Church, to witness the other way, to witness for
     Him, to be a matter of fact, as undeniable as the shining of the
     sun, that there was such a principle as conscience in the world, as
     faith, as fear of GOD; that there were men who considered themselves
     bound to live as His servants. The common answer which we hear made
     every day to persons who engage in any novel undertaking, is, "You
     will get no one to join you; nothing can come of it; you are
     singular in your opinion; you do not take practical views, but are
     smit with a fancy, with a dream of former times," &c. How cheering
     it is to a person so circumstanced, to be able to point to others
     elsewhere, who actually hold the same opinions as himself, and exert
     themselves for the same objects! Why? because it is an appeal to a
     fact, which no one can deny; it is an evidence that the view which
     influences him is something external to his own mind, and not a
     dream. What two persons see, cannot be an ideal apparition. men are
     governed by such facts, much more than by argumentative proof. These
     act upon the imagination. let a person be told ten times over than
     an opinion is true, the fact of its being said becomes an argument
     for the truth of it; i.e. it is so with most men. We see from time
     to time the operation of this principle of our nature in political
     matters. Our American colonies revolt; France feels the sympathy of
     the event, and is revolutionized. Again, in the same colonies, the
     Episcopal Church flourishes; we Churchmen at home ail it as an omen
     of the Church's permanence among ourselves. On the other hand,
     what can be more dispiriting than to find a cause, which we
     advocate, sinking in some other country or neighbourhood, though
     there be no reason for concluding, that, because it has fallen
     elsewhere, therefore it will among ourselves? In order then to
     supply this need of our minds, to satisfy the imagination, and so to
     help our faith, for this among other reasons, CHRIST set up a
     visible Society, His Church, to be as a light upon a hill, to all
     the ends of the earth, while time endures. It is a witness of the
     unseen world; a pledge of it; and a prefiguration of what will
     hereafter take place. It prefigures the ultimate separation of good
     and bad, holds up the great laws of GOD'S Moral Governance, and
     preaches the blessed truths of the Gospel. It pledges to us the
     promises of the next world, for it is something (so to say) in hand;
     CHRIST has done one work as the earnest of another. and it witnesses
     the truth to the whole world; awing sinners, while it inspires the
     fainting believer. And in all these ways it helps forward the world
     to come; and further, as the keeper of the Sacraments, it is an
     essential means of the realizing it at present in our fallen race.
     Nor is it much to the purpose, as regards our duty towards it, what
     are the feelings and spiritual state of the individuals who are its
     officers. True it is, were the Church to teach a heretical doctrine,
     it might become incumbent upon us (a miserable obligation!) to
     separate from it. But, while it teaches substantially the Truth, we
     ought to look upon it as one whole, one ordinance of GOD, not as
     composed of individuals, but as a House of GOD'S
     building;---as an instrument in His hand, to be used and
     reverenced for the sake of its Maker.

     Now the Papists have retained it; and so they have the advantage of
     possessing an instrument, which is, in the first place, suited to
     the needs of human nature; and next, is a special gift of CHRIST,
     and so has a blessing with it. Accordingly we see that in its
     measure success follows their zealous use of it. They act with great
     force upon the imaginations of men. The vaunted antiquity, the
     universality, the unanimity of their Church puts them above the
     varying fashions of the world, and the religious novelties of the
     day. And truly when one surveys the grandeur of their system, a sigh
     arises in the thoughtful mind, to think that we should be separate
     from them; Cum talis sis, utinam noster esses!---But, alas, AN
     UNION IS IMPOSSIBLE. Their communion is infected with heterodoxy; we
     are bound to flee it, as a pestilence. They have established a lie
     in the place of GOD'S truth; and, by their claim of
     immutability in doctrine, cannot undo the sin they have committed.
     They cannot repent. Popery must be destroyed; it cannot be reformed.

     Now then what is the Christian to do? Is he forced back upon that
     cheerless atheism (for so it practically must be considered) which
     prevailed in the world before CHRIST'S coming, poorly
     alleviated, as it was, by the received polytheisms of the heathen?
     Can we conceive a greater calamity to have occurred at the time of
     our Reformation, one which the Enemy of man would have been more set
     on effecting, than to have entangled the whole of the Church
     Catholic in the guilt of heterodoxy, and so have forced every one
     who worshipped in spirit and in truth, to flee out of doors into the
     bleak world, in order to save his soul? I do not think that Satan
     could have desired any event more eagerly, than such an alternative;
     viz. to have forced Christians, either to remain in communion with
     error, or to join themselves in some such spontaneous union among
     themselves, as is dissolved as easily as it is formed. Blessed be
     GOD! his malice has been thwarted. I do believe it to be one most
     conspicuous mark of GOD'S adorable Providence over us, as great
     as if we saw a miracle, that Christians in England escaped in the
     evil day from either extreme, neither corrupted doctrinally, nor
     secularized ecclesiastically. Thus in every quarter of the world,
     from North America, to New South Wales, a Zoar has been provided for
     those who would fain escape Sodom, yet dread to be without shelter.
     I hail it as an omen amid our present perils, that our Church will
     not be destroyed. He hath been mindful of us; He will bless us. He
     has wonderfully preserved our Church as a true branch of the Church
     Universal, yet withal preserved it free from doctrinal error. It is
     Catholic and Apostolic, yet not Papistical.

     With this reflection before us, doe sit not seem to be utter
     ingratitude to an astonishing Providence of GOD'S mercy, to be
     neglectful, as many Churchmen now are, of the gift? to attempt
     unions with those who have separated from the Church, to break down
     the partition walls, and to argue as if religion were altogether and
     only a matter of each man's private concern, and that the State
     and Nation were not bound to prefer the Apostolic Church to all
     self-originated forms of Christianity? But this is a point beside my
     purpose. Take the matter merely in the light of human expedience.
     Shall we be so far less wise in our generation than the children of
     this world, as to relinquish the support which the Truth receives
     from the influence of a Visible Church upon the imagination, from
     the energy of operation which a well-disciplined Body ensures? Shall
     we not foil the Papists, not with their own weapons, but with
     weapons which are ours as well as theirs? or, on the other hand,
     shall we with a melancholy infatuation give them up to them? Depend
     upon it, to insist on the doctrine of the Visible Church is not to
     favour the Papists, it is to do them the most serious injury. It is
     to deprive them of their only strength. But if we neglect to do so,
     what will be the consequence? Break down the Divine Authority of our
     Apostolical Church, and you are plainly preparing the way for Popery
     in our land. Human nature cannot remain without visible guides; it
     chooses them for itself, if it is not provided for them. If the
     Aristocracy and the Church fall, Popery steps in. Political events
     are beyond our power, and perhaps out of our sphere; but
     ecclesiastical matters are in the hands of all Churchmen.
