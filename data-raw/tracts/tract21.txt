                MORTIFICATION OF THE FLESH A SCRIPTURE DUTY.

                                 [Number 21]
     __________________________________________________________________

     If we take the example of the Holy men of Scripture as our guide,
     certain bodily privation and chastisement area very essential duty
     to all who wish to serve GOD, and prepare themselves for his
     presence.

     1. First we have the example of Moses. His recorded Fasts were
     miraculous; still they were Fasts, and the ordinance was to the
     notice of all believers afterwards, by the honour put upon it. "I
     abode in the mount forty days and nights; I neither did eat bread
     nor drink water." Again; "I fell down before the LORD, as at the
     first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor
     drink water, because of all your sins." Deut. ix. 9. 18. Fasting is
     in the former instance subservient to divine contemplation, in the
     latter to humiliation and intercession for sinners.

     Elijah. "He said unto him, What manner of man was he which came up
     to meet you, and told you these words? And they answered him, He was
     an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of lather about his loins. And
     he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite." 2 Kings i. 7, 8. It is indeed
     needless to show the ascetic character of him who was in fact the
     chief and type of those who "wandered about in sheepskins and
     goatskins," "in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of
     the earth." He too fasted by the power of GOD for forty days and
     nights; "He arose and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of
     that meat forty days and forty nights, unto Horeb the mount of GOD."
     1 Kings xix. 8.

     Daniel. "I set my face unto the LORD GOD, to seek by prayer and
     supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes; and I unto
     the LORD my GOD, and made my confession." Dan. ix. 3, 4. It must be
     observed, that Daniel was not bound by any vow, as Samson and
     Samuel. Moreover it would appear the gift of prophecy was given him
     in reward for his self-chastisements, as the following passage
     shows. "In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks; I ate
     no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth; neither
     did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled
     And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the
     words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I
     now sent . Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst
     set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy
     GOD, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words." Dan. x. 2,
     3. 11, 12. Vide also Luke ii. 37. Acts x. 30.

     2. Now here it will be objected, perhaps, that these instances are
     taken from the Old Testament, and belong to the Law of Moses, which
     is not binding on Christians.

     I answer;

     (1.) That in the above passages Fasting is connected with moral
     acts, humiliation, prayer, meditation, which are equally binding on
     us as on the Jews. Man is now what he was then; and if affliction of
     the flesh was good then, it is now.

     (2.) In matter of fact, private Fasting, such as instanced in the
     passages above quoted, was no special duty of the Mosaic Law. Public
     Fasting, indeed, was on one occasion enjoined by Moses himself, and
     on others by subsequent Rulers; but this was in part a ceremonial
     act, not a moral discipline, and was doubtless abolished with the
     other rites of the Law.

     "Of Fasts," says Lewis, "there was no more than one appointed by the
     Law of Moses, called the Fast of Expiation. .. The great day of
     Expiation was a most severe Fast, kept every year upon the tenth day
     of the month Tizri, which answers to our September. . . . . . This
     solemnity was observed with fasting and abstinence, not only from
     all meat and drink, but from all other pleasure whatsoever; insomuch
     that they did not wash their faces, much less anoint their heads,
     nor wear their shoes, nor, (if their Doctors say true,) read any
     portion of the law which would give them delight. They refrained
     likewise not only from pleasure, but from labour, nothing being to
     be done upon this day, but confessing of sins and repentance."

     Nay, it may rather be said, that the Jewish Law, as such, was rather
     opposed than otherwise to austerities. The Nazarites and Rechabites,
     being exceptions to the rule, are evidence of it. Vide, on the other
     band, Deut. xii. Eccles. v. 18.

     Such then being the character of the Law in its formal letter, it
     tells just the contrary way to that which superficial reasoners
     might expect. For it is most remarkable, first, that the greatest
     prophets under it, such as Elijah and Daniel, were without express
     command singularly austere and self-afflicting men, in the midst of
     a people, who from the first went lusting after "the fish which they
     eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks,
     and the onions, and the garlick, and said, Who shall give us flesh
     to eat?" Next there is something of a very startling and admonitory
     nature in the miraculous fasts of Moses and Elijah, under this same
     imperfect dispensation. The miracle evidently was for some purpose;
     yet it did not sanction, in any direct way, any injunction of the
     Law. Was it not an admonition to the Israelites, that there was a
     more excellent way of obedience that which ALMIGHTY GOD as yet
     thought fit to promulgate by solemn enactment? Is it not an
     intimation serviceable for Christian practice, as much as Moses
     announcement of the destined "Prophet like unto him" is intended for
     the comfort of Christian faith?

     Surely the duty of bodily discipline might be rested on the answer
     to this plain question, Why did Daniel use austerities not enjoined
     by the Law?

     3. Now turn to the New Testament, and observe what clear light is
     therein thrown upon the duty already recommended to us by the Old
     Testament Saints.

     First, there is the instance of St. John the Baptist. "John came
     neither eating nor drinking," Matt. xi. 18: and his disciples
     fasted, Matt. ix. 14.

     OUR SAVIOUR did not statedly fast; but here also the exception
     proves the rule. He who did not fast statedly was the only one born
     of woman who was untainted by sinful flesh; which seems to imply,
     that all who are natural descendants of guilty Adam ought to fast.

     He bade His disciples to fast Consider his implied precept, is an
     express command to those who obey the Law of Liberty. "When thou
     fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face, that thou appear not
     unto men to fast." Matt. vi. 17, 18.

     Consider, moreover, the general austere character of Christian
     obedience, as enjoined by our LORD;---a circumstance much to be
     on in an age like this, when what is really self-indulgence is
     thought to be a mere moderate and innocent use of this world's
     goods. I will but refer to a few, out of many texts, which I am
     persuaded are now forgotten by numbers of educated and amiable men
     who are fond of extolling what they call the mild, tolerant,
     enlightened spirit of the Gospel. Matt. v. 29, 30. vii. 13, 14. x
     37---39. Mark ix. 43---50. x. 25. Luke xiv. 12. 26---33.

     And reflect, too, whether the spirit of texts such as the following
     will not move every true member of the Church Militant. "The ark,
     and Israel, and Judah abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the
     servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then
     go into mine house, to eat and to drink?. . . . . as thou liveth,
     and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing. 2 Sam. xi. 11.

     Now take the example of the Apostles. St. Peter was fasting, when he
     had the vision which sent him to Cornelius : Acts x.. 10. The
     prophets and teachers at Antioch were fasting, when the HOLY GHOST
     revealed to them His purpose about Saul and Barnabas: Acts iii. 2,
     3. Vide also Acts xiv. 23. 2 Cor. vi. 5. xi. 27.

     Weigh well the following text, which I am persuaded many men would
     deny to be St. Paul's writing, had not a gracious Providence
     preserved to us the epistle containing it. "I keep under my body,
     and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means, when I have
     preached to others, I myself should be a cast-away." 1 Cor. ix. 27.

     4. Lastly, Consider the practice of the Primitive Christians.

     The following account of the early Christian Fasts, is from Bingham,
     Antiq. lib. xxi.

     THE QUADRAGESIMAL OR LENT FAST.---"The Quadragesimal Fast before
     Easter," says Sozomen, "some observe six weeks, as the Illyrian and
     Western Churches, and all Libya, Egypt, and Palestine; others make
     it seven weeks, as the Constantinopolitans and neighbouring nations
     as far as Phoe;nicia; others fast three only of those six or
     seven weeks, by intervals; others the three weeks next immediately
     before Easter."

     The manner of observing Lent among those that were piously disposed
     to observe it, was to abstain from all food till evening. For
     anciently a change of diet Was not reckoned a fast; but it consisted
     in perfect abstinence from all sustenance for the whole day till
     evening.

     THE FASTS OF THE FOUR SEASONS.---The next Anniversary fasting
     days were those which were called Jejunia quatuor temporum, the
     Fasts of the Four Seasons of the Year .......These were at first
     designed to beg a blessing of God upon the several seasons of the
     year, or to return thanks for the benefits received in each of them,
     or to exercise and purify both body and soul in a more particular
     manner, at the return of these certain terms of stricter discipline
     and more extraordinary devotion. [These afterwards became the Ember
     Fasts.]

     MONTHLY FASTS.---In some places they had also Monthly Fasts
     throughout the year excepting in the two months of July and August
     .. because of the sickness of the season.

     WEEKLY FASTS.---Besides these they had their weekly Fasts on
     Wednesday and Friday, called the Stationary Days, and Half-Fasts, or
     Fasts of the Fourth and Sixth Days of the Week .. These Fasts being
     of continual use every week throughout the Year, except in the Fifty
     Days between Easter and Pentecost, were not kept with that rigour
     and strictness which was observed in the time of Lent [but]
     ordinarily held no longer than 9 o'clock, i. e. 3 in the
     afternoon.
