                    THE FAITH AND OBEDIENCE OF CHURCHMEN,
                         THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH.

     AND Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the CHRIST the Son of
     the Living GOD. And JESUS answered and said unto him, Blessed art
     thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto
     thee, but MY FATHER which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee,
     That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build My Church; and
     the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." Matt. xvi. 16-18.

     The rock, then, upon which the Church is built, is the confession,
     that JESUS is the CHRIST, the Son of the Living GOD; a truth set
     forth and shadowed by the Prophets, but openly and plainly taught by
     the Apostles. St. Paul uses a similar expression, when he speaks of
     the body of Christians being "built upon the foundation of the
     Apostles and Prophets;" (i. e. resting in the sound and true
     doctrine which they taught;) "JESUS CHRIST Himself being the chief
     corner-stone," (Ephes. ii. 20.);-our very spiritual existence
     depending upon our adherence to this great truth that JESUS was the
     anointed Son of GOD, GOD and Man, the promised SAVIOUR of the
     world;-He, who by taking man's nature upon Him in the womb of
     the Blessed Virgin. fulfilled the prophecy that the SAVIOUR should
     be of the seed of Abraham, in whom "all the nations of the earth
     should be blessed," (Gen. xxii. 18.) and the seed of the woman, who
     should "bruise the serpent's head," (Gen. iii. 15.);-and who,
     inasmuch as He was "the Only begotten SON of GOD," (John iii. 18.)
     "GOD of GOD," "Very GOD of very GOD," (Nicene Creed,) fulfilled the
     prophecy, that the SAVIOUR should be " the mighty GOD," (Isaiah ix.
     G.);-He of whom it was said, "Let all the Angels of GOD worship
     Him," (Heb. i. 6.);-and of whom it was likewise said, "Thy throne, O
     GOD, is for ever and ever," Ps. xlv. 6.

     I said, that our very spiritual existence depends upon our adhering
     to this great and fundamental truth; and this I said not of us as
     individuals only, but as Members of the Church of CHRIST, and of
     that portion of CHRIST'S CHURCH in this Kingdom which is
     usually called the Church of England. It is true of us individually,
     as appears by the words of St. John; " He that hath the SON, bath
     life; and he that hath not the SON of GOD, hath not life ;" (1 John
     v. 12.); by which we learn, that as long as we slight or disbelieve,
     or deny this sacred truth, we have no spiritual life in us. It is
     also true of us, as Members of the Church of CHRIST, and of that
     portion of CHRIST'S Church in this Kingdom which is usually
     called the Church of England, as appears from the passage before us;
     "Upon this rock," (i. e. upon this firm confession of faith in JESUS
     as the Christ, the Son of the Living GOD,) "I will build My Church;
     and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." For from this
     we learn, that the Church, and any given portion of that Church, is
     only then able to defy the assaults of the Devil, that she can only
     then look forward with confidence to get the victory, so long as she
     adheres firmly to this faith and belief in CHRIST. When she departs
     from that foundation, then she ceases to have a claim for the
     continuance of the promised aid. This is a matter which it behoves
     Christians at all times to place before their eyes, and to keep in
     remembrance; but especially at the present time, does it behove us,
     who are Members of the Church of CHRIST in England, to do so:
     because of the unceasing endeavours which are being made by men who
     are either careless of religion altogether, or who have embraced
     false views of it, to overthrow our Church; endeavours, which we
     have reason to regard either with fear, or not, according as we have
     reason, or not, to suppose that the Members of the Church have
     departed from the true faith and fear of GOD, and of the LORD JESUS
     CHRIST. If there is reason to believe that many or most of the
     Members of our Church are regardless of that true faith, and of the
     honour of Him in whom we believe, that by their lips, or by their
     lives, they set at nought His Majesty, neglect His sacraments,
     despise His Word, forsake His Worship, obey not His Voice, or look
     for redemption and salvation by any other means than by His Cross
     and Blood, then we have every reason to fear that these endeavours
     of our enemies will be successful; that the light of GOD'S
     presence will be withheld from us; and that, as He withdrew from the
     Jews, when they neglected CHRIST, the LORD of Glory, so He will
     withdraw from our Nation also, and leave it to the wretchedness of
     its own chosen ways; to the enjoyment of those idols, the world, the
     flesh and the Devil, for which it will have forsaken the HOLY ONE of
     Israel, and refused to hearken to the voice of the LAMB of GOD, who
     died to take away the sins of the world. But if not, if we have
     reason to hope that there are many true servants of GOD still to be
     found; that there are many who, not with their lips only, but in
     their hearts and with their lives acknowledge Him the only true GOD,
     and JESUS CHRIST whom He has sent; acknowledge Him so as to obey His
     voice, and keep and do what He has commanded; then may we regard the
     attempts of our enemies without dismay; then may we have firm and
     stedfast hope that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against us:
     that though it may please GOD that we should suffer for a while;-as
     we suffered together with good King Charles at the hands of the
     Dissenters; as we suffered in the days of bloody Queen Mary, at the
     hands of the Roman Catholics; as we suffered during the first three
     hundred years after CHRIST, at the hands of the Heathens and the
     Jews;-yet that eventually triumph will await us; that He will bring
     our Church out of the trial, like gold out of the fire, more pure
     and of greater worth, ("I will purely purge away thy dross, and take
     away all thy tin ;" Is. i. 25.) that "all things will work together
     for good "to us; and that the purpose aimed at by the affliction is,
     that He "may present our Church to Himself as a glorious Church, not
     having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be
     holy and with out blemish." Ephes. v. 27.

     It will hence appear, that it is in the power of every individual,
     by a holy and religious life in the true faith and fear of GOD and
     our LORD JESUS CHRIST, to promote not only his own salvation, but
     the welfare and stability of the Church of CHRIST; or by an unholy,
     careless, and irreligious life, not only to secure his own
     damnation, but to assist the enemies of GOD and man, who are
     purposed to overthrow that Church.

     If times of confusion and trouble shall come, where can we seek for
     comfort but in the love of CHRIST, in the love of GOD to man for
     CHRIST'S sake? But how can we then take comfort in that love,
     if now we take no account of it? Let me entreat you, then, Christian
     Brethren, while the days of peace are vouchsafed to you, to give
     more and more heed to all religious duties. The days may come, when
     your Churches will be shut up, or only filled by men who will not
     teach the whole truth as it is in JESUS; when you will be deprived
     of Ministers of Religion; or have only such as are destitute of
     GOD'S Commission. Do not, I beseech you, by your neglect now,
     add to your misery then the bitterness of self-reproach, when you
     will have to say, "I had once the opportunity of worshipping GOD
     aright, but I neglected it, and He now has withheld it from me. I
     had once the means of receiving the Body and Blood of my SAVIOUR, at
     the hands of His own Minister; but I refused it, and now He has
     placed it out of my power."
