     CHAPTER V.

     The doctrine of Transubstantiation is contained neither in Scripture
     nor in the writings of the Fathers.

     THE word Transubstantiation is so far from being found either in the
     Sacred Records, or in the Monuments of the Ancient Fathers, that the
     maintainers of it do themselves acknowledge that it was no so much
     as heard of before the twelfth century. For though one Stephanus,
     Bishop of Autun, be said to have once used it, yet it is without
     proof that some modern writers make him one of the tenth century;
     nor yet doth he say, that the Bread is transubstantiated, but as it
     were transubstantiated, which well understood might be admitted.

     Nay, that the thing itself without the word, that the doctrine
     without the expression, cannot be found in Scripture, is ingeniously
     acknowledged by the most learned Schoolmen, Scotus, Durandus, Biel,
     Cameracensis, Cajetan, and many more, who finding it not brought in
     by the Pope's authority, and received in the Roman Church, till
     1200 years after CHRIST, yet endeavoured to defend it by other
     arguments.
       _______________________________________________________________

     And indeed, the words of institution would plainly make it appear to
     any man that would prefer truth to wrangling, that it is with the
     Bread that the LORD'S Body is given, (as His Blood with the
     Wine,) for CHRIST, having taken, blessed, and broken the Bread,
     said, "This is My Body;" and St. Paul, than whom none could better
     understand the meaning of CHRIST, explains it thus; "The Bread which
     we break is the [koinonia], Communion or communication of the Body
     of CHRIST," that whereby His Body is given, and the faithful are
     made partakers of it. That it was Bread which He reached to them,
     there was no need of any proof, the receiver's senses
     sufficiently convinced them of it; but that therewith His Body was
     given, none could have known, had it not been declared by Him who is
     the Truth itself. And though, by the divine institution and the
     explication of the Apostle, every faithful communicant may be as
     certainly assured that he receives the LORD'S Body, as if he
     knew that the Bread is substantially turned into it; yet it doth not
     therefore follow, that the Bread is so changed, that its substance
     is quite done away, so that there remains nothing present, but the
     very natural Body of CHRIST, made of Bread; for certain it is, that
     the Bread is not the Body of CHRIST any otherwise than as the Cup is
     the New Testament, and two different consequences cannot be drawn
     from those two not different expressions. Therefore as the Cup
     cannot be the New Testament but by a Sacramental figure, no more can
     the Bread be the Body of CHRIST, but in the same sense.

     As to what Bellarmine and others say, that it is not possible the
     words of CHRIST can be true, but by that conversion, which the
     Church of Rome calls Transubstantiation, that is so far from being
     so, that if it were admitted, it would first deny the Divine
     Omnipotency, as though GOD were not able to make the Body of CHRIST
     present, and truly to give it in the Sacrament, whilst the substance
     of the Bread remains. 2. It would be inconsistent with the Divine
     Benediction which preserves things in their proper being. 2. In
     [sic] would be contrary to the true nature of the Sacrament, which
     always consisteth of two parts. And lastly, it would in some manner
     destroy the true substance of the Body and Blood of CHRIST, which
     cannot be said to be made of Bread and Wine by a Priest, without a
     most high presumption. But the truth of the words of CHRIST remains
     constant, and can be defended, without overthrowing so many other
     great truths. Suppose a testator puts deeds and titles in the hand
     of his heir, with these words, ;Take the house which I bequeath
     thee;' there is no man will think that those writings and
     parchments are that very house which is made of wood or stones, and
     yet no man will say that the testator spake falsely or obscurely.
     Likewise our blessed SAVIOUR, having sanctified the Elements by His
     words and prayers, have them to His Disciples as seals of the New
     Testament, whereby they were as certainly secured of those rich and
     precious legacies which He left to them, as children are of their
     father's lands and inheritance, by deeds and instruments signed
     and delivered for that purpose.

     To the Sacred Records we may added [sic] the judgment of the
     Primitive Church. For those orthodox and holy Doctors of our holier
     religion, those great lights of the Catholic Church, do all clearly,
     constantly, and unanimously conspire in this, that the presence of
     the Body of CHRIST in the Sacrament is only mystic and spiritual. As
     for the entire annihilation of the substance of the Bread and Wine,
     or that new and strange tenet of Transubstantiation, they did not so
     much as hear or speak any thing of it; nay, the constant stream of
     their doctrine doth clearly run against it, how great soever are the
     brags and pretences of the Papists to the contrary. And if you will
     hear them one by one, I shall bring some of their most noted
     passages only, that our labour may not be endless by rehearsing all
     that they have said to our purpose on this subject.

     I shall begin with that holy and ancient Doctor, Justin Martyr, who
     is one of the first after the Apostles' times, whose undoubted
     writings are come to us. (A.D. 144.) What was believed at Rome and
     elsewhere in his time, concerning this holy mystery, may well be
     understood out of these his words: "After that the Bishop hath
     prayed and blessed, and the people said Amen, those whom we called
     Deacons or Ministers give to every one of them that are present a
     portion of the Bread and Wine; and that food we call the Eucharist,
     for we do not receive it as ordinary bread and wine." They received
     it as bread, yet not as common bread. And a little after; "By this
     food digested, our flesh and blood are fed, and we are taught that
     it is the Body and Blood of JESUS CHRIST." Therefore the substance
     of the bread remains, and remains corruptible food, even after the
     Consecration, which can in now wise be said of the immortal Body of
     CHRIST; for the Flesh of CHRIST is not turned into our flesh,
     neither doth it nourish it, as doth that food which is sacramentally
     called the Flesh of CHRIST. But the Flesh of CHRIST feeds our souls
     unto eternal life.

     After the same manner, it is written by that holy Martyr Irenaeus,
     Bishop much about the same time. (A.D. 160.) "The bread which is
     from the earth is no more common bread, after the invocation of GOD
     upon it, but is become the Eucharist, consisting of two parts, the
     one earthly, and the other heavenly." There would be nothing earthly
     if the substance of the bread were removed. Again: "As the grain of
     wheat falling in the ground, and dying, riseth again much increased,
     and then receiving the word of GOD becomes the Eucharist; (which is
     the Body and Blood of CHRIST;) so likewise our bodies, nourished by
     it, laid in the ground and dissolved, shall rise again in their
     time." Again; "We are fed by the creature, but it is He Himself that
     gives it. He hath ordained and appointed that Cup which is a
     creature, and His Blood also, and that Bread which is a creature,
     and also His Body. And so when the Bread and the Cup are blessed by
     GOD'S word, they become the Eucharist of the Body and Blood of
     CHRIST, and from them our bodies receive nourishment and increase."
     Now that our flesh is fed and encreased [sic] by the natural Body of
     CHRIST, cannot be said without great impiety by themselves that hold
     Transubstantiation. For naturally nothing nourisheth our bodies but
     what is made flesh and blood by the last digestion, which it would
     be blasphemous to say of the incorruptible Body of CHRIST. Yet the
     sacred Elements, which in some manner are, and are said to be the
     Body and Blood of CHRIST, yield nourishment and encrease to our
     bodies by their earthly nature, in such sort, that by virtue also of
     the heavenly and spiritual food which the faithful receive by means
     of the material, our bodies are fitted for a blessed Resurrection to
     immortal glory.

     Tertullian, who flourished about the two hundredth year after
     CHRIST, when as yet he was Catholic, and acted by a pious zeal,
     wrote against Marcion the Heretic, who, amongst his other impious
     opinions, taught that CHRIST had not taken of the Virgin Mary the
     very nature and substance of a human body, but only the outward
     forms and appearances; out of which fountain the Romish
     Transubstantiators seem to have drawn their doctrine of accidents
     abstracted from their subject hanging in the air, that is,
     subsisting on nothing. Tertullian, disputing against this wicked
     heresy, draws an argument from the Sacrament of the Eucharist, to
     prove that CHRIST had not a phantastic and imaginary, but a true and
     natural body, thus: the figure of the Body of CHRIST proves it to be
     natural, for there can be no figure of a ghost or phantasm. "But,"
     saith he, "CHRIST having taken the Bread, and given it to his
     Disciples, made it His Body by saying, ;This is my Body, that
     is, the figure of my Body.' Now, it could not have been a
     figure except the Body was real, for a mere appearance, an imaginary
     phantasm is not capable of a figure." Each part of this argument is
     true, and contains a necessary conclusion. For, 1. The bread must
     remain bread, otherwise Marcion would have returned the argument
     against Tertullian, sating as the Transubstantiators; it was not
     bread, but merely the accidents of bread, which seemed to be bread.
     2. The Body of CHRIST is proved to be true by the figure of it,
     which is said to be bread, for the bread is fit to represent that
     Divine Body, because of its nourishing virtue, which in the bread is
     earthly, but in the Body is heavenly. Lastly, the reality of the
     Body is proved by that of its figure; and so if you deny the
     substance of the Bread, (as the Papists do,) you thereby destroy the
     truth and reality of the Body of CHRIST in the Sacrament.

     Origen also, about the same time as Tertullian, speaks much after
     the same manner. "If CHRIST," saith he, "as these men (the
     Marcionites) falsely hold, had neither Flesh nor Blood, of what
     manner of Flesh, of what Body, of what Blood did He give the signs
     and images when He gave the Bread and Wine?" If they be the signs
     and representations of the Body and Blood of CHRIST, though they
     prove the truth of His Body and Blood, yet they being signs, cannot
     be what they signify; and they not being what they represent, the
     groundless contrivance of Transubstantiation is overthrown. Also
     upon Leviticus he doth expressly oppose it thus: "Acknowledge ye
     that they are figures, and therefore spiritual, not carnal; examine
     and understand what is said, otherwise if you receive as things
     carnal, they will hurt, but not nourish you. For in the Gospel there
     is the Letter, which kills him that understands not spiritually what
     is said; for if you understand this saying according to the Letter,
     ;Except you eat My Flesh and drink My Blood,' the Letter
     will kill you." Therefore as much as these words belong to the
     eating and drinking of CHRIST'S Body and Blood, they are to be
     understood mystically and spiritually.
       _______________________________________________________________

     St. Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage, a glorious Martyr of CHRIST, (A.D.
     250.) wrote a famous Epistle to Coecilius concerning the sacred
     Chalice in the LORD'S Supper, whereof this is the sum; "Let
     that cup which is offered to the people in commemoration of CHRIST
     be mixt with wine," (against the opinion of the Aquarii, who were
     for water only,) "for it cannot represent the Body and Blood of
     CHRIST when there is no wine in the cup, because the Blood of CHRIST
     is exprest by the Wine, as the faithful are understood by the
     Water." But the patrons of Transubstantiation have neither Wine nor
     Water in the Chalice they offer; and yet without them (especially
     the Wine appointed by our Blessed SAVIOUR, and whereof Cyprian
     chiefly speaks,) the Blood of CHRIST is not so much as sacramentally
     present. So far was the Primitive Church from any thing of believing
     a corporal presence of the Blood, the Wine being reduced to nothing,
     (that is, to a mere accident without the substance,) for then they
     must have said, that the Water was changed into the people, as well
     as the Wine into the Blood. But there is no need that I should bring
     many testimonies of that Father, when all his writings do plainly
     declare that the true substance of the Bread and Wine is given in
     the Eucharist; that the spiritual and quickening food which the
     faithful get from the Body and Blood of CHRIST, and the mutual union
     of the whole people joined into one body may answer their type, the
     Sacrament which represents them.

     The words of the Council of Nice, (A.D. 325.) are well known,
     whereby the faithful are called from the consideration of the
     outward visible Elements of Bread and Wine, to attend the inward and
     spiritual act of the mind, whereby CHRIST is seen and apprehended.
     "Let not our thoughts dwell low, on that Bread and that Cup which
     are set before us, but lifting up our minds by faith, let us
     consider, that on this Sacred Table is laid the Lamb of GOD which
     taketh away the sins of the world. And receiving truly His precious
     Body and Blood, let us believe these things to be the pledges and
     emblems of our resurrection; for we do not take much, but only a
     little, (of the Elements,) that we may be mindful, we do it not for
     satiety, but for sanctification." Now, who is there, even among the
     maintainers of Transubstantiation, that will understand this, not
     much, but a little, of the Body of CHRIST; or who can believe that
     the Nicene Fathers would call His Body and Blood symbols in a proper
     sense? when nothing can be an image or sign of itself. And
     therefore, though we are not to rest in the Elements, minding
     nothing else, (for we should consider what is chiefest in the
     Sacrament, that we have our hearts lifted unto the LORD, who is
     given together with the signs,) yet Elements they are, and the
     earthly part of the Sacrament, both the Bread and the Wine, which
     destroys Transubstantiation.

     St. Athanasius, famous in the time, and present in the Assembly of
     the Nicene Council, a stout Champion of the Catholic faith,
     acknowledgeth none other but a spiritual manducation of the Body of
     CHRIST in the Sacrament. "Our LORD," saith he, "made a difference
     betwixt the Flesh and the Spirit, that we might understand that what
     He said, was not carnal, but spiritual. For how many men could His
     Body have fed, that the whole world should be nourished by it? But
     therefore He mentioned His ascension into heaven, that they might
     not take what He said in a corporal sense, but might understand that
     His Flesh whereof He spake is a spiritual and heavenly food given by
     Himself from on high; for the words that I spake unto you they are
     spirit, and they are life, as if He should say, My Body which is
     shown and given for the world, shall be given in good, that it may
     be distributed spiritually to every one, and preserve them all to
     the resurrection to eternal life." Cardinal Perron having nothing to
     answer to these words of this holy Father, in a kind of despair,
     rejects the whole Tractate, and denies it to be Athanasius's,
     which nobody ever did before him, there being no reason for it.
       _______________________________________________________________

     Likewise St. Ambrose, (A.D. 380.) explaining what manner of
     alteration is in the Bread, when in the Eucharist it becomes the
     Body of CHRIST, saith, "Thou hadst indeed a being, but wert an old
     creature, but being now baptized or consecrated, thou art become a
     new creature." The same change that happens to man in baptism,
     happens to the Bread in the Sacrament: if the nature of man is not
     substantially altered by the new birth, no more is the Bread by
     consecration. Man becomes by baptism, not what nature made him, but
     what grace new-makes him; and the Bread becomes by consecration, not
     what it was by nature, but what the blessing consecrates it to be.
     For nature made only a mere man, and made only common bread; but
     Regeneration, of a mere man, makes a holy man, in whom CHRIST dwells
     spiritually; and likewise the Consecration of common Bread makes
     Mystic and Sacramental Bread. Yet this change doth not destroy
     nature, but to nature adds grace; as is yet more plainly exprest by
     that holy Father in the fore-cited place. "Perhaps thou wilt say,"
     saith he, "this my bread is common bread; it is bread indeed before
     the blessing of the Sacrament, but when it is consecrated it becomes
     the Body of CHRIST. This we are therefore to declare, how can that
     which is Bread be also the Body of CHRIST? By Consecration. And
     Consecration is made by the words of our LORD, that the venerable
     Sacrament may be perfected. You see how efficacious is the word of
     CHRIST. If there be then so great a power in the Word of CHRIST to
     make the Bread and Wine to be what they were not, how much greater
     is that power which still preserves them to be what they were, and
     yet makes them to be what they were not? Therefore, that I may
     answer thee, it was not the Body of CHRIST before the Consecration,
     but now after the Consecration, it is the Body of CHRIST; He said
     the word and it was done. Thou thyself went before, but wert an old
     creature; after thou hadst been consecrated in Baptism thou art
     become a new creature." By these words St. Ambrose teacheth how we
     are to understand that the Bread is the Body of CHRIST, to wit, by
     such a change that the Bread and Wine do not cease to be what they
     were as to their substance, (for then they should not be what they
     were,) and yet by the blessing become what before they were not. For
     so they are said to remain, (as indeed they do,) what they were by
     nature, that yet they are changed by grace; that is, they become
     assured Sacraments of the Body and Blood of CHRIST, and by that
     means certain pledges of our Justification and Redemption. What is
     there, can refute more expressly the dream of Transubstantiation?

     St. Chrysostom (A.D. 390.) doth also clearly discard and reject this
     carnal Transubstantiation and eating of CHRIST'S Body, without
     eating the Bread. "Sacraments," saith he, "ought not to be
     contemplated and considered carnally, but with the eyes of our
     souls, that is, spiritually; for such is the nature of mysteries;"
     where observe the opposition betwixt carnally and spiritually, which
     admits of no plea or reply again. "As in Baptism the spiritual power
     of Regeneration is given to the material water; so also the
     immaterial gift of the Body and Blood of CHRIST is not received by
     any sensible corporal action, but by the spiritual discernment of
     our faith, and of our hearts and minds." Which is no more than this,
     that sensible things are called by the name of those spiritual
     things which they seal and signify. But he speaks more plainly in
     his Epistle to Caesarius; where he teacheth, that in this mystery,
     there is not in the bread a substantial, but a Sacramental change,
     according to the which, the outward Elements take the name of what
     they represent, and are changed in such a sort, that they still
     retain their former natural substance. "The Bread," saith he, "is
     made worthy to be honoured with the name of the Flesh of CHRIST, by
     the consecration of the Priest, yet the Flesh retains the properties
     of its incorruptible nature, as the Bread doth its natural
     substance. Before the Bread be sanctified we call it Bread; but when
     it is consecrated by the divine grace, it deserves to be called the
     LORD'S Body, though the substance of the real Bread remains."
     When Bellarmine could not answer this testimony of that great
     Doctor, he thought it enough to deny, that this Epistle is St.
     Chrysostom's; but both he and Possevin do vainly contend that
     it is not extant among the works of Chrysostom. For besides that at
     Florence and elsewhere it was to be found among them, it is cited in
     the collection against the Severians which are in the version of
     Turrianus the Jesuit, in the 4th tome of Antiq. Lectionum of Henry
     Canisius, and in the end of the book of Joh. Damascenus against the
     Acephali.
       _______________________________________________________________

     Which also hath been said by St. Austin (A.D. 400.) above a thousand
     times; but out of so many almost numberless places, I shall choose
     only three, which are as the sum of all the rest. "You are not to
     eat this Body which you see, nor drink this Blood which My
     crucifiers shall shed; I have left you a Sacrament which,
     spiritually understood, will vivify you." Thus St. Austin,
     rehearsing the words of CHRIST again; "If Sacraments had not some
     resemblance with those things whereof they are Sacraments, they
     could not be Sacraments at all. From this resemblance they often
     take the names of what they represent. Therefore as the Sacrament of
     CHRIST'S Body is in some sort His Body; so the Sacrament of
     Faith, is faith also." To the same sense is what he writes against
     Maximinus the Arian. "We mind in the Sacraments, not what they are,
     but what they show; for they are signs, which are one thing, and
     signifies another." And in another place, speaking of what they
     signify, for our LORD was pleased to say, ;this is My
     Body,' when He gave the sign of His Body.'"
       _______________________________________________________________

     And the same kind of expressions ......... were also used by
     venerable Bede, our countryman, who lived in the eighth century, in
     his Sermon upon the Epiphany; of whom we also take these two
     testimonies following: "In the room of the Flesh and Blood of the
     Lamb, CHRIST substituted the Sacrament of His Body and Blood, in the
     figure of Bread and Wine." Also, "At Supper He gave to His Disciples
     the figure of His holy Body and Blood." These utterly destroy
     Transubstantiation.

     In the same century Charles the Great wrote an Epistle to our
     Alcuinus, wherein we find these words. "CHRIST at Supper broke the
     Bread to His Disciples, and likewise gave them the Cup, in figure of
     His Body and Blood, and so left to us this great Sacrament for our
     benefit." If it was the figure of His Body, it could not be the Body
     itself; indeed the Body of CHRIST is given in the Eucharist, but to
     the faithful only, and that by means of the Sacrament of consecrated
     Bread.

     But now, about the beginning of the ninth century, started up
     Paschasius, a Monk of Corbie, who first, (as some say whose judgment
     I follow not,) among the Latines, taught that CHRIST was
     consusbtantiated, or rather inclosed in the Bread, and corporally
     united to it in the Sacrament; for as yet there was no thoughts of
     the Transubstantiation of the Bread. But these new sorts of
     expressions not agreeing with the Catholic doctrine, and the
     writings of the ancient Fathers, had few or no abettors before the
     eleventh century. And in the ninth, whereof we now treat, there were
     not wanting learned men, (as Amalarius, Archdeacon of Triars;
     Rabanus, at first Abbot of Fulda, and afterwards Archbishop of
     Ments; John Erigena, an English Divine; Waldfridus Strabo, a German
     Abbot; Ratramus or Bertramus, first Priest of Corbie, afterward
     Abbot of Orbec in France; and many more;) who by their writings
     opposed this new opinion of Paschasius, or of some others rather,
     and delivered to posterity the Doctrine of the Ancient Church. Yet
     we have something more to say concerning Paschasius, whom Bellarmine
     and Sirmondus esteemed so highly, that they were not ashamed to say,
     that he was the first that had writ to the purpose concerning the
     Eucharist; and that he had so explained the meaning of the Church,
     that he had shown and opened the way to all them who treated of that
     subject after him. Yet in that whole book of Paschasius, there is
     nothing that favours the Transubstantiation of the Bread, or its
     destruction or removal. Indeed, he asserts the truth of the Body and
     Blood of CHRIST'S being in the Eucharist, which Protestants
     deny not; he denies that the consecrated Bread is a bare figure, a
     representation void of truth, which Protestants assert not. But he
     has many things repugnant to Transubstantiation, which, as I have
     said, the Church of Rome itself had not yet quite found out. I shall
     mention a few of them. "CHRIST," saith he, "left us this Sacrament,
     a visible figure and character of His Body and Blood, that by them
     our spirit might the better embrace spiritual and invisible things,
     and be more fully fed by faith." Again, "We must receive our
     spiritual Sacrament with the mouth of the soul, and the taste of
     faith." Item, "Whilst therein we savour nothing carnal, but we being
     spiritual, and understanding the whole spiritually, we remain in
     CHRIST." And a little after, "The Flesh and Blood of CHRIST are
     received spiritually." And again, "To savour according to the Flesh,
     is death; and yet to receive spiritually the true Flesh of CHRIST,
     is life eternal." Lastly, "The Flesh and Blood of CHRIST are not
     received carnally, but spiritually.
       _______________________________________________________________

     As for the opinion of Bertram, otherwise called Ratramnus, or
     Ratramus, perhaps not rightly, it is known enough by that books
     which the Emperor Charles the Bald, (who loved and honoured him, as
     all good men did, for his great learning and piety,) commanded him
     to write concerning the Body and Blood of our LORD. For when men
     began to be disturbed at the book of Paschasius, some saying one
     thing, and some another, the Emperor being moved by their disputes
     propounded himself two questions to Bertram. 1. Whether, what the
     faithful eat in the Church, be made the Body and Blood of CHRIST in
     figure and mystery. 2. Or whether that natural Body which was born
     of the Virgin Mary, which suffered, died, and was buried, and now
     sitteth on the right hand of GOD the Father, be itself daily
     received by the mouth of the faithful in the mystery of the
     Sacrament. The first of these Bertram resolved affirmatively, the
     second negatively; sand said, that there was as great a difference
     betwixt those two bodies, as betwixt the earnest and that whereof it
     is the earnest. "It is evident," saith he, "that that Bread and Wine
     are figuratively the Body and Blood of CHRIST. According to the
     substance of the Elements, they are after the Consecration what they
     were before. For the Bread is not CHRIST substantially. If this
     mystery be not done in a figure, it cannot well be called a mystery.
     The Wine also which is made the Sacrament of the Blood of CHRIST by
     the Consecration of the Priest, shews one thing by its outward
     appearance, and contains another inwardly. For what is there visible
     in its outside but only the substance of the Wine? These things are
     changed, but not according to the material part, and by this change
     they are not what they truly appear to be but are something else
     besides what is their proper being; for they are made spiritually
     the Body and Blood of CHRIST; not that the Elements be two different
     things, but in one respect they are, as they appear, Bread and Wine,
     and in another the Body and Blood of CHRIST. Hence, according to the
     visible creature they feed the body; but according to the virtue of
     a more excellent substance they nourish and sanctify the souls of
     the faithful." Then having brought many testimonies of holy
     Scripture and the ancient Fathers to confirm this, he at last
     prevents that calumny which the followers of Paschasius did then lay
     on the orthodox, as though they had taught that bare signs, figures,
     and shadows, and not the Body and Blood of CHRIST were given in the
     Sacrament. "Let it not be thought," saith he, "because we say this,
     that therefore the Body and Blood of CHRIST are not received in the
     mystery of the Sacrament, where faith apprehends what it believeth,
     and not what the eyes see; for this meat and drink are spiritual,
     feed the soul spiritually, and entertain that life whose fulness is
     eternal." For the question is not simply about the real truth, or
     the thing signified being present, without which it could not be a
     mystery, but about the false reality of things subsisting in
     imaginary appearances, and about the carnal presence.

     All this the Fathers of Trent, and the Romish Inquisitors could not
     brook, and therefore they utterly condemned Bertram, and put his
     book in the Catalogue of those that are forbidden.

       Romish objections considered, as drawn from the writings of the
                                   Fathers.
       _______________________________________________________________

     ....LET us see what props these new builders pretend to borrow from
     Antiquity to uphold their castle in the air, Transubstantiation.
     They use indeed to scrape together many testimonies of the Fathers
     of the first and middle age, whereby they would fain prove, that
     those Fathers believed and taught the Transubstantiation of the
     Bread and Wine into the natural Body and Blood of CHRIST, just as
     the Roman Church, as this day, doth teach and believe. We will
     therefore briefly examine them, that it may yet more fully appear
     that Antiquity and all Fathers did not in the least favour the new
     tenet of Transubstantiation; but that, that true doctrine which I
     have set down in the beginning of this book, was constantly owned
     and preserved in the Church of CHRIST.

     Now, almost all that they produce out of the Fathers will be
     conveniently reduced to certain heads, that we may not be too
     tedious in answering each testimony by itself.

     1. To the first head belong those that call the Eucharist the Body
     and Blood of CHRIST. But I answer, those Fathers explain themselves
     in many places, and interpret those their expressions in a manner,
     that they must be understood in a mystic and spiritual sense, in
     that Sacraments usually take the names of those things they
     represent, because of that resemblance which they have with them;
     not by the reality of the thing, but by the signification of the
     mystery; as we have been shown before out of St Austin and others.
     For nobody can deny, but that the things that are seen are signs and
     figures, and those that are not seen, the Body and Blood of CHRIST.
     And that therefore the nature of this mystery is such, that when we
     receive the Bread and Wine, we also together with them receive at
     the same time the Body and Blood of CHRIST, which, in the
     celebration of the holy Eucharist, are as truly given as they are
     represented. Hence came into the Church this manner of speaking,
     ;The consecrated Bread is CHRIST'S Body.'

     2. We put in the second rank those places that say, that the Bishops
     and Priests make the Body of CHRIST with the sacred words of their
     mouth, as St. Hierom speaks in his Epistle to Heliodorus, and St.
     Ambrose, and others. To this I say, that at the prayer and blessing
     of the Priest, the common bread is made Sacramental Bread, which,
     when broke and eaten, is the Communion of the Body of CHRIST, and
     therefore may well be called so, sacramentally. For the Bread, (as I
     have often said before,) doth not only represent the Body of our
     LORD, but also being received, we are truly made partakers of that
     precious Body. For so saith St. Hierom; "The Body and Blood of
     CHRIST is made at the prayer of the Priest;" that is, the Element is
     so qualified, that being received it becomes the Communion of the
     Body and Blood of CHRIST, which it could not without the preceding
     prayers. The Greeks call this, "to prepare and consecrate the Body
     of the LORD." As St. Chrysostom saith well; "These are not the works
     of man's power, but still the operation of Him, who made them
     in the last Supper; as for us, we are only Ministers, but He it is
     that sanctifies and changeth them."

     3. In the third place, to what is brought out of the Fathers,
     concerning the conversion, change, transmutation, transfiguration,
     and transelementation of the Bread and Wine in the Eucharist,
     (wherein the Papists do greatly glory, boasting of the consent of
     Antiquity with them,) I answer, that there is no such consequence.
     Transubstantiation being another species of change, the enumeration
     was not full, for it doth not follow, that because there is a
     conversion, a transmutation, a transelementation, there should be
     also a Transubstantiation; which the Fathers never so much as
     mentioned. For because this is a Sacrament, the change must be
     understood to be sacramental also, whereby common Bread and Wine
     become the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of CHRIST; which could
     not be, did not the substance of the Bread and Wine remain, for a
     Sacrament consisteth of two parts, an earthly and a heavenly. And
     so, because ordinary Bread is changed by consecration into a Bread
     which is no more of common use, but appointed by divine institution
     to be a sacramental sign, whereby is represented the Body of CHRIST,
     in whom dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead bodily, and being
     thereby dignified, having great excellencies superadded, and so made
     what it was not before, it is therefore said by some of the Fathers
     to be changed, to be made another thing. And truly that change is
     great and supernatural, but yet not substantial, not of a substance
     which substantially ceaseth to be, into another substance which
     substantially beginneth to be, but it is a change of state and
     condition which alters not the spiritual properties of the Element.
     This is also confirmed by Scripture, which usually describes and
     represents the conversion of men, and the supernatural change of
     things, as though it were natural, though it be not so. So those
     that are renewed by the Word, and Spirit, and Faith of CHRIST, are
     said to be regenerated, converted, and transformed, to put off the
     old man, and put on the new man, and to be new creatures; but they
     are not said to become another substance, to be transubstantiated;
     for men thus converted are still the same human body, and the same
     rational soul as before, though in a far better state and condition,
     as every Christian will acknowledge. Nay, the Fathers themselves
     used those words, Transmutation, Transformation, Transelementation,
     upon other occasions, when they speak of things whose substance is
     neither lost nor changed.

     4. To the fourth head I refer what the Fathers say of our touching
     and seeing the Body of CHRIST, and drinking His Blood in the
     Sacrament; and thereto I answer, that we deny not but that some
     things emphatical, and even hyperbolical, have been said of the
     Sacrament by Chrysostom, and some others; and that those things may
     easy lead unwary men into error. That was the ancient Fathers'
     care, as it is ours still, to instruct the people not to look barely
     on the outward Elements, but in them to eye with their minds the
     Body and Blood of CHRIST, and with their hearts lift up to feed on
     that heavenly meat; for all the benefit of a Sacrament is lost, if
     we look no further than the Elements. Hence it is that those holy
     men, the better to teach this lesson to their hearers, and move
     their hearts more efficaciously, spake of the signs as if they had
     been the things signified, and like orators said many things which
     will not bear a literal sense, nor a strict examen. Such is this, of
     an uncertain author under the name of St. Cyprian; "We are close to
     the Cross, we such the Blood, and we put our tongues in the very
     wounds of our REDEEMER, so that, both outwardly and inwardly we are
     made red thereby." Such is that of St. Chrysostom; "In the Sacrament
     the Blood of drawn out of the side of CHRIST, the tongue is made
     bloody with that wonderful Blood." Again, "Thou seeth thy LORD
     sacrificed, and the crowding multitude round about sprinkled with
     His Blood; He that sits above with the FATHER is at the same time in
     our hands. Thou doth see and touch and eat Him. For I do not shew
     thee either Angels or Archangels, but the LORD of them Himself."
     Again; "He incorporates us with Himself, as if we were but the same
     thing. He makes us His Body indeed, and suffers us not only to see,
     but even to touch, to eat Him, and to put our teeth in His Flesh; so
     that by that food which He gives us, we become His Flesh." Such is
     that of St. Austin; "Let us give thanks, not only that we are made
     Christians, but also made CHRIST." Lastly, such is that of Leo; "In
     that mystical distribution, it is given us to be made His Flesh."
     Certainly, if any man would wrangle and take advantage of these, he
     might thereby maintain, as well that we are transubstantiated into
     CHRIST, and CHRIST'S Flesh into the Bread, as that the Bread
     and Wine are transubstantiated into His Body and Blood. But
     Protestants who scorn to play the sophisters, interpret these and
     the like passages of the Fathers, with candour and ingenuity, (as it
     is most fitting they could.) For the expressions of Preachers, which
     often have something of a paradox, must not be taken according to
     that harsher sound wherewith they at first strike the auditor's
     ears. The Fathers spake not of any transubstantiated bread, but of
     the mystical and consecrated, when they used those sorts of
     expressions; 1. That they might extol and amplify the dignity of
     this mystery, which all true Christians acknowledge to be very great
     and peerless. 2. That communicants might not rest in the outward
     Elements, but seriously consider the thing represented, whereof they
     are most certainly made partakers, if they be worthy receivers. 3.
     And lastly, that they might approach so great a mystery with the
     more zeal, reverence, and devotion. And that those hyperbolic
     expressions are thus to be understood, the Fathers themselves teach
     clearly enough, when they come to interpret them.
       _______________________________________________________________

     5. Lastly, being the same holy Fathers who, (as the manner is to
     discourse of Sacraments,) speak sometimes of the Bread and Wine in
     the LORD'S Supper, as if they were the very Body and Blood of
     CHRIST, do also very often call them types, elements, signs, the
     figure of the Body and Blood of CHRIST; from hence it appears most
     manifestly, that they were of the Protestants, and not of the
     Papists' opinion. For we can without prejudice to what we
     believe of the Sacrament, use those former expressions which the
     Papists believe, do most favour them, if they be understood, as they
     ought to be, sacramentally. But the latter none can use, but he must
     thereby overthrow the groundless doctrine of Transubstantiation;
     these two, the Bread is transubstantiated into the Body, and the
     Bread also is a type, the sign, the figure of the Body of CHRIST,
     being wholly inconsistent. For it is impossible that a thing that
     loseth its being should yet be the sign and representation of
     another; neither can any thing be the type and the sign of itself.

     But if without admitting of a sacramental sense the words be used
     too rigorously, nothing but this will follow; that the Bread and
     Wine are really and properly the very Body and Blood of CHRIST,
     which they themselves disown, that hold Transubstantiation.
     Therefore in this change, it is not a newness of substance, but of
     use and virtue that is produced; which yet the Fathers acknowledged
     with us, to be wonderful, supernatural, and proper only to
     GOD'S Omnipotency; for that earthly and corruptible meat cannot
     become to us a spiritual and heavenly, the Communion of the Body and
     Blood of CHRIST, without GOD'S especial power and operation.
     And whereas it is far above philosophy and human reason, that CHRIST
     from Heaven, (where alone He is locally,) should reach down to us
     the divine virtue of His Flesh, so that we are made one body with
     Him; therefore it is as necessary as it is reasonable, that the
     Fathers should tell us, that we ought with singleness of heart to
     believe the SON of GOD, when He saith, This is My Body; and that we
     ought not to measure this high and holy mystery by our narrow
     conceptions, or by the course of nature. For it is more acceptable
     to GOD with an humble simplicity of faith to reverence and embrace
     the words of CHRIST, than to wrest them violently to a strange and
     improper sense, and with curiosity and presumption to determine what
     exceeds the capacity of men and Angels.

                                 CHAPTER VII.

      History of the rise of the Romish Doctrine of Transubstantiation.

     WE have proved it before, that the leprosy of Transubstantiation did
     not begin to spread over the body of the Church in a thousand years
     after CHRIST. But at last the thousand years being expired, and
     Satan loosed out of his prison, to go and deceive the nations, and
     compass the camp of the Saints about, then, to the great damage of
     Christian peace and religion, they began here and there to dispute
     against the clear, constant, and universal consent of the Fathers,
     and to maintain the new-started opinion. It is known to them that
     understand History, what manner of times were then, and what were
     those Bishops who then governed the Church of Rome; Sylvester II.
     John XIX. and XX. Sergius IV. Benedictus VIII. John XXI. Benedict
     IX. Sylvester III. Gregory VI. Damasus II. Leo IX. Nicholas II.
     Gregory VII. or Hildebrand; who tore to pieces the Church of Rome
     with grievous schisms, cruel wars, and great slaughters. For the
     Roman Pontificate was come to that pass, that good men being put by,
     they whose life and doctrine was pious being oppressed, none could
     obtain that dignity, but they that could bribe best, and were most
     ambitious.

     In that unhappy age the learned were at odds about the presence of
     the Body of CHRIST in the Sacrament; some defending the ancient
     doctrine of the of the Church, and some the new-sprung-up opinion.

     Fulbert, Bishop of Chartres, (A.D. 1010.) was tutor to Berengarius,
     whom we shall soon have occasion to speak of, and his doctrine was
     altogether conformable to that of the Primitive Church, as appears
     clearly out of his Epistle to Adeodatus, wherein he teacheth, "That
     the mystery of faith in the Eucharist, is not to be looked on with
     our bodily eyes, but with the eyes of our mind. For what appears
     outwardly Bread and Wine, is made inwardly the Body and Blood of
     CHRIST; not that which is tasted with the mouth, but that which is
     relished by the heart's affection. "Therefore," saith he,
     "prepare the palate of thy faith, open the throat of thy hope, and
     enlarge the bowels of thy charity, and take that Bread of life which
     is the food of the inward man." Again, "The perception of a divine
     taste proceeds from the faith of the inward man, whilst by receiving
     the saving Sacrament, CHRIST is received into the soul." All this is
     against those who teach in too gross a manner, that CHRIST in this
     mystery enters carnally the mouth and stomach of the receivers.

     Fulbert was followed by Berengarius, his scholar, Archdeacon of
     Angers in France, a man of great worth, by the holiness both of his
     life and doctrine.
       _______________________________________________________________

     Berengarius stood up valiantly in defence of that doctrine which 170
     years before, was delivered out of GOD'S Word and the holy
     Fathers, in France, by Bertram, and John Erigena, and by others
     elsewhere, against those who taught that in the Eucharist neither
     Bread nor Wine remained after the Consecration. Yet he did not
     either believe or teach, (as many falsely and shamelessly have
     imputed to him,) that nothing more is received in he LORD'S
     Supper, but bare signs only, or mere Bread and Wine; but he believed
     and openly profest, as St. Austin and other faithful Doctors of the
     Church had taught out of GOD'S Word, that in this mystery, the
     souls of the faithful are truly fed by the true Body and Blood of
     CHRIST to life eternal. nevertheless it was neither his mind nor his
     doctrine, that the substance of the Bread and Wine is reduced to
     nothing, or changed into the substance of the natural Body of
     CHRIST; or, (as some then would have had the Church believe,) that
     CHRIST Himself comes down carnally from heaven. Entire books he
     wrote upon this subject, but they have been wholly supprest by his
     enemies, and now are not to be found. Yet what we have of him in his
     greatest enemy Lanfrank, I here set down; "By the Consecration at
     the Altar the Bread and Wine are made a Sacrament of Religion; not
     to cease to be what they were, but to be changed into something
     else, and to become what they were not;" agreeable to what St.
     Ambrose had taught. Again, "There are two parts in the Sacrifice of
     the Church, (this is according to St. Irenaeus,) the visible
     Sacrament, and the invisible thing of the Sacrament; that is, the
     Body of CHRIST." Item, "The Bread and Wine which are consecrated,
     remain in their substance, having a resemblance with that whereof
     they are a Sacrament, for else they could not be a Sacrament."
     Lastly, "Sacraments are visible signs of divine things, but in them
     the invisible things are honoured." All this agrees well with St.
     Austin, and other Fathers above cited.

     He did not therefore by this his doctrine exclude the Body of CHRIST
     from the Sacrament, but in its right administration he joined
     together the thing signified with the sacred sign; and taught that
     the Body of CHRIST was not eaten with the mouth in a carnal way, but
     with the mind, and soul, and spirit. Neither did Berengarius alone
     maintain this orthodox and ancient doctrine; for Sigibert, William
     of Malmesbury, Matthew Paris, and Matthew of Westminster, make it
     certain, that almost all the French, Italians, and English of those
     times were of the same opinion; and that many things were said,
     writ, and disputed in its defence by many men; amongst whom was
     Bruno, then Bishop of the same Church of Angers. Now this greatly
     displeaseth the Papal faction, who took great care that those
     men's writings should not be delivered to posterity, and now do
     write, that the doctrine of Berengarius, owned by the Fathers, and
     maintained by many famous nations, skult only in some dark corner or
     other.

     The first Pope who opposed himself to Berengarius was Leo the Ninth,
     a plain man indeed, but too much led by Humbert and Hildebrand. For
     as soon as he was desired, he pronounced sentence of excommunication
     against Berengarius absent and unheard; and not long after he called
     a council of Verceil, wherein John Erigena and Berengarius were
     condemned, upon this account, that they should say, that the Bread
     and Wine in the Eucharist are only bare signs; which was far from
     their thoughts, and further yet from their belief. This roaring
     therefore of the lion frightened not Berengarius; nay, the Gallican
     Churches did also oppose the Pope, and his Synod of Verceil, and
     defend with Berengarius the oppressed truth.

     To Leo succeeded Pope Victor the Second, who seeing Berengarius
     could not be cast down and crushed by the fulminations of his
     predecessor, sent his legate Hildebrand into France, and called
     another Council at Tours, where Berengarius being cited, did freely
     appear, and whence he was freely dismissed, after he had given it
     under his hand, that the Bread and Wine in the Sacrifice of the
     Church, are not shadows and empty figures; and that he held none
     other but the common doctrine of the Church concerning the
     Sacrament. For he did not alter his judgment, (as modern Papists
     give out,) but he persisted to teach and maintain the same doctrine
     as before, as Lanfrank complains of him.

     Yet his enemies would not rest satisfied with this, but they urged
     Pope Nicholas the Second, who, (within a few months that Stephen the
     Tenth sate,) succeeded Victor without the Emperor's consent, to
     call a new Council at Rome against Berengarius. For, that sensual
     manner of presence, by them devised, to the great dishonour of
     CHRIST, being rejected by Berengarius, and he teaching as he did
     before, that the Body of CHRIST was not present in such a sort, as
     that it might be at pleasure brought in and out, taken into the
     stomach, cast on the ground, trod under foot, and bit or devoured by
     any beasts, they falsely charged him as if he had denied that it is
     present at all. An hundred and thirteen Bishops came to the Council,
     to obey the Pope's mandate; Berengarius came also. "And, (as
     Sigonius and Leo Ostensius say,) when non present could withstand
     him, they sent for one Albericus, a Monk of Mount Cassin, made
     Cardinal by Pope Stephen:" who having asked seven days' time to
     answer in writing, brought at last his scroll against Berengarius.
     The reasons and arguments used therein to convince his antagonist
     are not now extant, but whatever they were, Berengarius was
     commanded presently without any delay to recant, in that form
     prescribed and appointed by Cardinal Humbert, which was thus: "I
     Berengarius, &c. assent to the Holy Roman and Apostolic See, and
     with my heart and mouth do profess, that I hold that faith
     concerning the Sacrament of the LORD'S Table which our Lord and
     venerable Pope Nicholas, and this sacred Council, have determined
     and imposed upon me by their evangelic and apostolic authority; to
     wit, that the Bread and Wine which are set on the Altar, are not
     after the consecration only a sacrament, sign, and figure, but also
     the very Body and Blood of our LORD JESUS CHRIST; (thus far it is
     well enough, but what follows is too horrid, and is disowned by the
     Papists themselves;) and that they (the Body and Blood) are touched
     and broken with the hands of the Priests, and ground with the teeth
     of the faithful, not sacramentally only, but in truth and sensibly."
     This is the prescript of the Recantation imposed on Berengarius, and
     by him at first rejected, but by imprisonment, and threats, and fear
     of being put to death, at last extorted from him.

     The form of Recantation is to be found entire in Lanfrank, Algerus,
     and Gratian; yet the Glosser on Gratian, John Semeca marks it with
     this note; "Except you understand well the words of Berengarius,"
     (he should rather have said of Pope Nicholas, and Cardinal
     Humbertus,) "you shall fall into a greater heresy than his was, for
     he exceeded the truth, and spake hyperbolically." And so Richard de
     Mediavilla; "Berengarius being accused, overshot himself in his
     justification:" but the excess of his words should be ascribed to
     those who prescribed and forced them upon him. Yet in all this we
     hear nothing of Transubstantiation.

     Berengarius at last escaped out of this danger, and conscious to
     himself of having denied the truth, took heart again, and refuted in
     writing his own impious and absurd Recantation, and said, "That by
     force it was extorted from him by the Church of Malignants, the
     Council of Vanity." Lanfrank of Caen, at that time head of a
     Monastery in France, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, and
     Guitmundus Aversanus answered him. And though it is not to be
     doubted but that Berengarius, and those of his party, writ and
     replied again and again, yet so well did their adversaries look to
     it, that nothing of theirs remains, save some citations in Lanfrank.
     But is were to be wished that we had now the entire works of
     Berengarius, who was a learned man, and a constant follower of
     Antiquity; for out of them we might know with more certainty how
     things went, than we can out of what his profest enemies have said.

     This sacramental debate ceased awhile because of the tumults of war
     raised in Apulia and elsewhere by Pope Nicholas the Second; but
     began again as soon as Hildebrand, called Gregory the Seventh, came
     to the Papal chair. For Berengarius was cited again to a new Council
     at Rome, "where some being of one opinion and some another," (as it
     is in the acts of that Council, writ by those of the Pope's
     faction,) his cause could not be so entirely oppressed but that some
     Bishop were still found to uphold it. Nay, the ringleader himself,
     Hildebrand, is said to have doubted, "whether what we receive at the
     LORD'S Table be indeed the Body of CHRIST by a substantial
     conversion." but three months space having been granted to
     Berengarius, and a fast appointed to the Cardinals, "that GOD would
     shew by some sign from heaven, (which yet He did not,) who was in
     the right, the Pope or Berengarius, concerning the Body of the
     LORD;" at last the business was decided without any oracle from
     above, and a new form of retraction imposed on Berengarius, whereby
     he was henceforth forward to confess, under pain of the Pope's
     high displeasure, "that the mystic Bread," (first made magical and
     enchanting by Hildebrand,) "is substantially turned into the true
     and proper Flesh of CHRIST;" which whether he ever did is not yet
     certain. For though Malmesbury tells us, "that he died in that Roman
     faith," yet there are ancienter than he, who say, "that he never was
     converted from his first opinion." And some relate, "that after this
     last condemnation having given over his studies, and given to the
     poor all he had, he wrought with his own hands for his living."
     Other things related of him by some slaves of the Roman See,
     deserves no credit. These things happened, ...... in the year 1079;
     and soon after Berengarius died.

     Berengarius being dead the orthodox and ancient doctrine of the
     LORD'S Supper which he maintained did not die with him; (as the
     Chronicus Cassinensis would have it;) for it was still constantly
     retained by St. Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux, who lived about the
     beginning of the twelfth century. In his discourse on the
     LORD'S Supper, he joined together the outward form of the
     Sacrament, and the spiritual efficacy of it, as the shell and the
     kernel, the sacred sign, and the thing signified; the one he takes
     out of the words of the Institution, and the other, out of
     CHRIST'S Sermon in the sixth of St. John. And in the same place
     explaining, that Sacraments are not things absolute in themselves
     without any relation, but mysteries, wherein by the gift of a
     visible sign, an invisible and divine grace with the Body and Blood
     of CHRIST is given, he saith, "That the visible sign is as a ring,
     which is given not for itself or absolutely, but to invest and give
     possession of an estate made over to one." ..... Now, as no man can
     fancy that the ring is substantially changed into the inheritance,
     whether lands or houses, none also can say with truth, or without
     absurdity, that the Bread and Wine are substantially changed into
     the Body and Blood of CHRIST. But in his Sermon on the Purification,
     which none doubts to be his, he speaks yet more plainly; "The Body
     of CHRIST in the Sacrament is the food of the soul, not of the
     belly, therefore we eat him not corporally: but in the manner that
     CHRIST is meat, in the same manner we understand that he is eaten."
     Also in his Sermon on St. Martin, which undoubtedly is his also; "To
     this day," saith he, "the same flesh is given to us, but
     spiritually, therefore not corporally." For the truth of things
     spiritually present is certain also.

     The thirteenth century now follows; wherein the world growing both
     older and worse, a great deal of trouble and confusion there was
     about religion ..So that now there remained nothing but to confirm
     the new tenet of Transubstantiation, and impose it so peremptorily
     on the Christian world, that none might dare so much as to hiss
     against it. This Pope Innocent the Third bravely performed. He
     succeeding Celestin the Third at thirty years of age, and marching
     stoutly in the footsteps of Hildebrand, called a Council at Rome in
     St. John Lateran, and was the first that ever presumed to make the
     new-devised Doctrine of Transubstantiation an Article of Faith
     necessary to salvation, and that by his own mere authority.
       _______________________________________________________________

     In the fifteenth century the Council of Constance, (which by a
     sacrilegious attempt took away the sacramental cup from the people,
     and from the Priests when they do not officiate,) did wrongfully
     condemn Wiclif, who was already dead, because amongst other things
     he had taught with the Ancients, "That the substance of the Bread
     and Wine remains materially in the Sacrament of the Altar; and that
     in the same Sacrament, no accidents of Bread and Wine remain without
     a substance." Which two assertions are most true.
       _______________________________________________________________

     By these any considering person may easily see, that
     Transubstantiation is a mere novelty; nor warranted either by
     scripture or antiquity; invented about the middle of the twelfth
     century, out of some misunderstood sayings of some of the Fathers;
     confirmed by no ecclesiastical or Papal Decree before the year 1215,
     afterwards received only here and there in the Roman Church; debated
     in the schools by many disputes; liable to many very bad
     consequences; rejected, (for there was never those wanting that
     opposed it,) by many great and pious men, until it was maintained in
     the sacrilegious Council of Constance; and at last in the year 1551,
     confirmed in the Council of Trent, by a few Latin Bishops, slaves to
     the Roman See; imposed upon all, under pain of an anathema to be
     feared by none; and so spread too far, by the tyrannical and most
     unjust command of the Pope. So that we have no reason to embrace it,
     until it shall be demonstrated, that except the substance of the
     Bread be changed into the very Body of CHRIST, His words cannot
     possibly be true; nor His Body present. Which will never be done.
