     He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth Me,
     receiveth Him that sent Me.

     He that receiveth a prophet, in the name of a prophet, shall receive
     a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man, in
     the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's
     reward. Matt. x. 40, 41.

     JOHN EVANS was walking along the lane between his own house and the
     common, when just at the place where the lane makes a turning, he
     suddenly met Dr. Spencer, the Rector of his parish. John was not
     particularly pleased at thus meeting his Pastor, for several
     reasons. He had formerly been a most regular attendant at the parish
     church, from which he had lately chosen to absent himself, with his
     family. not that he stayed away from idleness, or from any
     intentional disregard of the commands of GOD; he felt, as he
     imagined, the same reverence for the Divine Will as ever; it was,
     indeed, rather a mistaken zeal than any thing else, which had led to
     his change of conduct. He had been induced, one Sunday, by a friend
     who belonged to a dissenting congregation, to go with him to the
     meeting-house; and when he was there, there was something in the
     energy of the preacher's manner, in the vehement action by
     which his teaching was accompanied, and in his seeming earnestness
     in the holy cause of GOD, which, as it was quite new to John, was
     particularly striking to him. Compared with the fervour of this man,
     the quiet but sound discourses of his Rector seemed spiritless and
     tame; and John came out of the meeting under the influence of such
     enthusiastic feelings, as led him to resolve to visit it again the
     first opportunity. And thus he was led on to go again and again,
     till at last he made up his min to become a regular attendant there.
     Thither he accordingly took his family, Sunday after Sunday; and
     deserted, of course, the old parish church, the venerable building
     in which he and his had received the holy rite of Baptism; in which,
     as each of them in turn outgrew their infancy, they had heard for
     the first time the solemn sound of congregational prayer; and in
     which those who had arrived at a proper age had frequently received
     from CHRIST'S authorized Ministers, the symbols of His sacred
     Body and Blood.

     It will be seen from what follows, that in making this change upon
     such grounds as have been described, John Evans did not understand
     that he was disobeying the GOD, whom he was trying to serve, and
     putting a slight upon that SAVIOUR, whose disciple he not only
     professed himself, but in good earnest desired to be. Yet though he
     did not enter into this view of the matter; though he knew not that
     he had shown disrespect to CHRIST, in His Minister; still he felt as
     though he had not been behaving with perfect respect to the Doctor,
     whom he loved on his own account, as he had indeed every reason to
     do. So what with his fear of a rebuke on this ground; a rebuke which
     he dreaded the more from the mildness of the language in which he
     knew that it would be clothed; what with the irksomeness of having
     to avow opinions which must be disagreeable to one whom he so highly
     respected; and, moreover, the suspicion which he could not help
     feeling, that in these new ways of his, so different form what he
     had been used to revere, and so suddenly taken up, he might possibly
     be wrong; for all these various reasons, he met his Pastor with a
     downcast and half-guilty look, very different from the open, honest
     smile with which he had till then, ever greeted the good Clergyman.

     Dr. Spencer, however, took no notice of the difference. "Well,
     John," said he, "I am glad to see you. I was on my way to have a
     little conversation with you, and should have been sorry to have
     missed you."

     John thought it best to be bold, and come out at once with his
     defence of himself "I believe, Sir," said he, "that I can guess what
     it is you were wishing to talk with me about. I have taken a step
     which I fear, I know, must be displeasing to you, Sir. I trust,
     however, that in exercising my Christian Liberty in the choice of my
     spiritual teacher, and joining the meeting instead of going to
     Church, I shall not seem to have acted from disrespect to you, Sir,
     who have so long been a good friend to me and mine."

     Dr.---By no means, John; do not suppose either that I feel
     personally offended at your conduct, or that I do not regard you
     with feelings as friendly as ever. But, as to the Christian Liberty
     you speak of, we perhaps understand that matter rather differently;
     and it was because I thought you were in some mistake about it, that
     I was coming to see you to-day. I have missed yourself and family
     for some Sundays past in Church, and understood you had joined the
     meeting. Is not this the case?

     John.---It is, Sir; and, as I have already said, without the
     slightest notion of showing you disrespect.

     Dr.---Say no more about that, John; I know you too well to
     suspect you for a moment of such a feeling as that. Speak to me as
     to your sincere friend and well-wisher, in perfect candour: and do
     not fear that I shall be offended at any thing you say, while you
     tell me fairly your reasons for this change in your conduct.

     J.---I am sure, Sir, that in the old Church I never heard any
     thing from you but what was good; and I never thought, till the
     other day, that I could pray better in any other words than in those
     of the Church Service. But there is something so fine in the prayers
     without book, as they are offered at meeting, and

     Dr.---And something perhaps in the manner and language of the
     preacher, who preaches there without a book also. But let me ask,
     had you no other reasons, than these, and such as these, for leaving
     the Church?

     J.---None, Sir; but such as these; at least, none that I am aware
     of.

     Dr.---You did not consider that either the Church Prayer-Book, or
     my Sermons, taught doctrines contrary to the great truths revealed
     in GOD'S Word?

     J.---God forbid, Sir.

     Dr.---You had, then, perhaps, some such notions as this; you
     though that in the Church you could pray well, but at meeting you
     could pray rather better?

     J.---Just so, Sir.

     Dr.---And you though that you were doing GOD service, then, by
     joining that worship which touched you most?

     J.---And surely, Sir, I was right in that thought, at least.

     Dr.--- You would have been right, if GOD had not chosen a
     Minister for you. In that case perhaps you might have used you
     Christian Liberty, as you call it, and joined any congregation and
     worship you pleased. But his having given a clear command alters the
     case, and makes that which would otherwise have been a matter of
     indifference, an act of disobedience and sin.

     J.---But if I may be so bold as to ask, Sir, when did GOD give
     this command, and where is it to be found? I am not so ready with
     the Bible as learned people, yet I know it in my own way. That was
     the very thing I heard Mr. Tims, who preaches at the meeting, ask
     last Sunday. He said, "Where is the Church of England spoken of in
     the Bible? name chapter and verse where we are bid belong to it."
     And then he went on to say, that the new heart is every thing, and
     that we shall not be asked at the last day, whether we were
     Churchmen or Dissenters, but what the state of our heart is.

     Dr.---We shall be asked at the last day whether we have obeyed
     GOD'S commandments; now, one of those commandments is, that we
     should belong to the Church, as I will soon show you. But, first,
     you shall tell me what has been your reason, till lately, for going
     to Church.

     J.---I was born of Church-going parents, and that made me a
     regular Church-goer in my youth. And when I grew up, I always, at
     least till the other day, thought that I had the best of reasons for
     keeping regular to Church. In the first place, the Church was the
     Law Church; and that of itself would be a reason, even if there were
     no other, for good subjects keeping to it; and then, I knew it had
     been in the country many, many years whereas all the meetings about
     are (so to say) of yesterday, and in one sense upstarts. And then I
     had heard from you, Sir, that in former times it had Saints and
     Martyrs, such as were when our LORD was on earth. and I thought it
     therefore far more likely to be right, and had a stronger claim on
     me than any other religion; and especially since I was a pretty
     regular reader of my Bible, and never found the teaching which I
     heard at Church different from that which I thus picked up at home.

     Dr.---All good reasons as far as they went; but I see that I was
     right in supposing the chief claim the Church has on all Christians
     is unknown to you. Our Church is sprung from that very Church which
     CHRIST set up at Jerusalem when He came upon earth; and none of the
     sects have this great gift. It is a branch of that Holy Church which
     CHRIST promised to be with, "even to the end of the world." You must
     surely often have met in the Bible with mention of "the Church;"
     what did you suppose the word to mean?

     J.---I do not know, Sir, that I had any very clear idea what it
     meant; but I rather thought it meant, all sincere Christians in all
     parts of the world, to whatever Church or sect they might belong.

     Dr.---Then it seems you did not understand the word "Church" to
     signify a body of men, bound by the same laws, acting together,
     speaking the same thing, attending the same worship, reverencing the
     same Pastors and Teachers, and receiving at their hands the
     Sacraments which CHRIST has ordained. Yet it is quite certain that
     this is what our LORD meant, when He spoke of His Church. He meant a
     Church such as the Church of England. This will be clear to you from
     Matt. xviii. 15, 16, 17. In these verses CHRIST speaks of the
     Church; in the last of them He bids His disciples regard any one who
     should in certain cases refuse to "hear the Church," as a heathen
     and a publican; as an opposer of His authority, and an outcast from
     His sacred fold. Thus it appears the Church He speaks of is not a
     mere number of good people scattered over the world, who may or may
     not have communion with each other, (which was your notion of the
     word) but one public, orderly, visible body, consisting of Ministers
     and people, such as the Church of England. To be sure, the Church of
     England happens to have wealth and honour, and that first

     Church has not; but this is but an accidental difference between
     them. If the Church of England were to lose its wealth and honour,
     it would not, could not, thereby cease to be a branch of the true
     Church; and by comparing the text just given you with Matt. xvi. 18,
     19, you will see that it was to this visible Church that the promise
     was made, that the gates of hell should not prevail against it.

     J.---If you would kindly write down these texts for me, I will
     turn them out of my own Bible, and think over them. There is one
     thing, however, Sir, which comes into my mind to ask you. Even
     supposing all Christians ought to join together into one, yet they
     do not. There are a good many religions among us, and how is a plain
     unlearned man like me to know which is the real Church spoken of in
     these passages?

     Dr.---The matter is not so difficult as you imagine, even to the
     most unlearned. The true Church must possess, as I will now show
     you, certain marks; to which not even a pretence is made by the
     numerous sects of Dissenters with which our country, from different
     unfortunate circumstances, abounds. let me go back to the time when
     the Gospel was first preached, and converts made by the Apostles.
     Many of these believers, we find, acknowledged in the Apostles the
     authority which CHRIST had given them over the flock, and were
     followers of them even as they were of CHRIST, (1 Cor. xi. 1.)
     remembering them in all things, and keeping the ordinances which
     they had delivered to the congregation in each place; and for this
     conduct the Corinthians received the inspired praise of St. Paul.
     (ibid. 2.) But there were others, who called themselves Christians,
     who caused divisions among the brethren, (1 Cor. ii. 18, 19.)
     forming parties of their own, and setting at nought the Apostolical
     Authority. To these St. Paul spoke in vain, when he said, "I beseech
     you, brethren, by the name of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, that ye all
     speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but
     that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the
     same judgment." (1 Cor. i. 10.) They slighted the LORD'S
     accredited Minister, and said that his bodily presence was weak, and
     his speech contemptible. (2 Cor. x. 10.) Many of the sects which
     these men formed, fell, as was to be expected, into follies and
     heresies; but even without reference to this fact, even if we
     suppose them to have taught the great doctrines of Christianity with
     the same purity as the Apostles did, could a reasonable man
     entertain a moment's doubt, granting CHRIST had indeed founded
     a Church on earth, which that Church was; whether the name of Church
     belonged to the company of Christians which obeyed His Apostles; or,
     on the other hand, to any one of the sects which vilified and
     despised them?

     J.---Certainly not; that is, there could be no doubt, as long as
     the Apostles were alive, that the Christians whom they governed must
     have made up the true visible Church of CHRIST.

     Dr.---But, John, it is plain you see, that there were a great
     number of sects then as there is now; so that a man, who wished to
     do his duty, would have to look about him carefully, and would be in
     danger of doing wrong, if he joined the first body of so-called
     Christians, which he met with!---a great number of sects, I
     repeat, even though the Apostles were alive; so that it is not the
     mere circumstance of the Apostles being dead, which makes a search
     necessary to find the true Church.

     J.--- I see what you would say, Sir.

     Dr.---Now then to proceed. You are disposed to doubt, whether one
     Church was truer than another after the Apostle's death. Surely
     is it not plain, that the Church would still be the true one, which
     they had governed? Now you will find, (Matt. xxviii. 19, 20.) that
     our LORD promised to be with His Apostles in their character of
     teachers and baptizers of the nations always, even unto the end of
     the world. What did He mean by that?

     J.---He could not mean that Peter, James, or John, or their
     brethren, were to live for ever on earth; for we know that they are
     long since dead.

     Dr.---Certainly not; and we must therefore ascribe to His words
     the only other meaning which they can reasonably bear. As he could
     not have spoken of the persons of the Apostles, he must have spoken
     of their offices. He must have meant that though Peter, James, and
     John should be taken from the world the true Church should never be
     left without Apostles, but be guided by their successors to the end
     of time.

     John Evans had all this while been retracing with Dr. Spencer the
     way he had lately come, and had now arrived at the door of his own
     house. The good clergyman thinking he had given him matter enough to
     cast in his mind, took this as a fit moment to break off the
     conversation, determining to resume it some early day. He therefore
     merely went into his parishioner's house, to turn out for him
     the texts he had referred to, and then wished him good evening.

     The next Sunday John was at Church; and after the service was over,
     he kept lingering in the path which led to the Dr.'s house, in
     hopes of being overtaken by his Rector. He was not disappointed. Dr.
     Spencer soon joined him, and the argument between them was resumed.

     J.---If, Sir, as you were saying, our LORD meant, that there
     should be teachers and rulers of the Church, to stand in the place
     of the Apostles after their death, how is it we hear nothing of
     these successors, so to call them, in Scripture?

     Dr.---On the other hand I affirm, we hear a great deal about them
     in Scripture, as you will agree with me. Surely you recollect the
     Apostles solemnly laying their hands on others, or, as it is called,
     ordaining them, to act as their assistants and fellows; and this
     they did, when Christians became too numerous for them to attend to
     them all by themselves. Such a person was Timothy, whom St. Paul
     thus consecrated by the putting on of his hands, (1 Tim. i. 6.) to
     bear rule over that branch of the Church which was established at
     Ephesus in Asia; such Titus, (Tit. i. 5.) whom he left with
     authority over the Church in the island of Crete, "to set in order
     the things that were wanting;" and such Epaphroditus, whom he sent
     to the Phillippians as his "brother, and companion in labour, and
     fellow-soldier, but their messenger," or Apostle. (Phil. ii. 25.)
     Now in the absence of the Apostles, what do you suppose would have
     been the conduct of all true Christians to these whom the Apostles
     had appointed?

     J.---Of course they would have shown them all honour and
     obedience, in order to show their respect for the Apostles
     themselves.

     Dr.---Certainly; as reverencing St. Paul, they would have
     attended to his plain doctrine; "Whether any do enquire of Titus, he
     is my partner and fellow-helper concerning you; or our brethren (i.
     e. Luke and another sent to act jointly with Titus) be enquired of,
     they are the Apostles of the Church, and the glory of CHRIST.
     Wherefore show yet to them and before the Churches, the proof of
     your love, and of our boasting on your behalf." (2 Cor. viii. 23,
     24.) On the other hand, how do you think these new Apostles would
     have been treated by those who slighted the authority of St. Peter
     and St. Paul?

     J.---Those who set at nought the Apostles themselves, would also
     set at nought those who stood in their place.

     Dr.---You see, then, that had we lived in the days of the
     Apostles, we should have had one plain test among others, for
     discovering the true Church, in spite of all counterfeits of it. The
     true Church was that Christian body, which was governed by men
     commissioned by the Apostles; and those who were perverse towards
     St. Peter and St. Paul, would have been disobedient towards them.
     But let us now go a step further. Do you suppose that Timothy, for
     instance, ceased to be an Apostles, such as St. Paul had made him,
     on the death of St. Paul?

     J.---I do not see why he should; but I should like to know
     whether there is proof from Scripture that he did not?

     Dr.---When St. Paul was just going to be put to death for the
     sake of the Gospel, he writes thus to Timothy: "Preach the Word! be
     instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all
     long-suffering and doctrine. . . . . . Watch thou in all things,
     endure affliction, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of
     thy ministry. For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my
     departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my
     course." (2 Tim. iv. 2---7.)

     J.---From these words it is certainly clear that St. Paul
     intended Timothy, whom he had appointed to act as his brother and
     fellow-labourer while he lived, to act as his successor when he
     should be no more.

     Dr.---And all true Christians, who have reverenced Timothy as if
     really St. Paul, when that Apostle was removed from them for a time
     by distance, would no less reverence him as such, when the Apostle
     was removed once for all by death.

     J.---They could do no less.

     Dr.---It follows, then, that even when the Apostles had all
     entered into their rest, i.e. in the second age of the Gospel, we
     might still have used the test I have given, to distinguish the
     Church of CHRIST from sects falsely claiming that name. We should
     have found the one set of Christians reverently sitting at the feet
     of the successors of Apostles; all the others so called, openly
     rejecting their rightful authority.

     J.---It is true; even while these successors of the Apostles
     lived, all who professed to obey CHRIST, were bound to pay them and
     would have paid them, a reverence which the false sects would not
     have paid; so that in those times there would certainly have been no
     difficulty in finding which was the Church, which it was our duty to
     join.

     Dr.---And when Timothy, Titus, or Epaphroditus, as exercising the
     same full authority which had been exercised by St. Paul, themselves
     appointed fellow-labourers and successors, committing, as the
     Apostle had enjoined one of them to do, the things which they had
     heard to faithful men who might be able to teach others also: (2
     Tim. ii. 2.) would not these faithful men be reverenced by all true
     Christians, for the very same reason which led them to reverence
     those who appointed them?

     J.---They would so, no doubt. As long as a direct line was
     continued from the Apostles themselves onwards, all consistent
     Christians must have paid them reverence. And such a succession
     might have gone on for a long while,---an hundred years or more.

     Dr.---What if it have now gone on for eighteen hundred years?
     What if, by the good providence of GOD, the line which began with
     the Apostles Peter and Paul should have continued even to this very
     day? so that there are men who stand in the place of the Holy Saints
     and Martyrs of Scripture up to this very hour, under the great and
     eternal Head of the Church? You look surprised, but such is the
     fact; and if such persons do really exist, and if we find one
     community of Christians acknowledging and obeying, and ruled by
     them, while every other body of professing Christians in our island
     disclaims and rejects them, you will see that this test will enable
     the most simple-minded and unlearned person to discriminate between
     the true Church of CHRIST and the unauthorized sects which called
     themselves CHRIST'S followers now, almost as clearly as he
     could had he lived in the days of the Apostles themselves.

     J.---Yes; the body of Christians, which reverences and is guided
     by the successors of the Apostles, must be the true Church of
     CHRIST. But who are these successors of the Apostles in our country?
     though, to be sure, I think I know what answer you will give me.

     Dr.---The Bishops of the Church of England are they. There is not
     one of them who cannot trace his right to guide and govern
     CHRIST'S Church, and to ordain its Ministers, through a long
     line of predecessors, up to the favoured persons who were
     consecrated by the laying on of the holy hands of St. Peter and of
     St. Paul. This is a fact which dissenters from the Church of England
     do not, and cannot deny: nor do they profess that the authority of
     those, whom they call their ministers, to teach and to administer
     the Sacraments, rests at all on such grounds as these.

     J.---I understand you, Sir; but I have one remark to make, if you
     will please to hear it. Bishops do not work miracles, as the
     Apostles did; nor can you mean that we are to look upon their
     teaching and writings now, as dictated by immediate inspiration, and
     consequently infallible, like the New Testament. How then are they
     successors of the Apostles?

     Dr.---You are bringing me to a large subject, John; which we will
     discuss some other time, not on a Sunday evening, when you have your
     young ones at home, waiting to say their verses to you; and I had
     rather rest than argue after the Services of the day. We will have
     some further talk when occasion offers; meanwhile, in answer to your
     inquiry, I will but bid you compare John XX. with Acts ii. The
     miraculous gifts were sent down upon the Apostles on the day of
     Pentecost; but the commission to preach, teach, and ordain, was
     given, quite independently of all such extraordinary endowments,
     before our SAVIOUR ascended into heaven. One word at
     parting.---You have had a good education; your mind has been
     opened to enter into arguments, to see objections, and answer
     questions: your understanding has been sharpened. This is a talent
     which may be used rightly, or abused; to the unwary all gifts are
     temptations. As riches betray men into selfishness and an evil
     security, so does a sharp wit tend to make them self-confident,
     arrogant, and irreverent. Look at the advantages which GOD has given
     you, not as a cause of boasting and self-gratification, but
     seriously and anxiously, as a treasure of which you are steward for
     GOD, and concerning which you must one day give account to him.
