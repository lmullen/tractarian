     He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth Me,
     receiveth Him that sent Me.

     He that receiveth a prophet, in the name of a prophet, shall receive
     a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man, in
     the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's
     reward. Matt. x. 40, 41.

     JOHN EVANS did not fail to look out in his Bible the texts to which
     Dr. Spencer had referred him; and he saw clearly that the miraculous
     powers with which it pleased GOD to endue the Apostles, were by no
     means necessarily connected with the commission which those Apostles
     had previously received from our LORD; the commission, we mean, to
     teach and baptize all nations.

     John was seen again on the next Sunday, at his accustomed place in
     church. The doctor preached from the text, Mark xvi. 17,18; "And
     these signs shall follow them that believe: in My name shall they
     cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take
     up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt
     them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."

     He pointed out to his congregation the beautiful regularity which
     pervades the works of God; the settled laws, the established order,
     with which our Maker guides the course of things around us; the
     certainty with which the stars rise and set, the moon waxes and
     wanes, the flower follows the bud, and the seed the flower. He
     reminded his hearers how truly, from the times of the flood,
     GOD'S promise has been fulfilled: and seed time and harvest,
     cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, have not ceased.
     (Gen. viii. 8.) "And surely," said he, "we see in these things the
     proofs that GOD is a God of order; that He would not lightly or
     without important reasons change the system which he has
     established, the laws which he has framed. If then we were to hear
     that the ALMIGHTY had on a certain occasion broken through these
     laws, and violated by miracles the established order of nature, we
     should have the strongest reason to suppose, 1st, that He had only
     done so in order to accomplish something which could not conceivably
     have been accomplished without such interpositions; and 2ndly, that
     He would discontinue these interpositions as soon as they became no
     longer necessary.

     "Now both these conclusions," continued the Doctor, "we find to
     agree alike with the Bible and with the recorded history of mankind.
     It was necessary that the doctrines of Christianity should be known
     to be the infallible truth of GOD; that what the Apostles said or
     wrote on the subject should be received as the words of GOD Himself
     speaking to mankind. Now this authority, as far as we can see, can
     be given to mortal man only by GOD'S visibly interfering in his
     support; and such interferences are what we call miracles. We see
     then, that for the establishment in the world of Christianity, and
     of the authority of those sacred books which form the New Testament,
     miracles were necessary; and we find from Scripture that miracles
     were then vouchsafed. But when the interference had been fully
     proved, when evidence of it could be handed down by ordinary means
     to following generations; and when no more divine truth was to be
     revealed, miracles were needed no longer; and the history of the
     world informs us, that they have ceased for seventeen hundred
     years."

     And while the Doctor, in conclusion, pointed out on the one hand the
     folly of expecting a recurrence of such marvels in our own days, an
     expectation which amounts to an acknowledgment that Christianity is
     as yet imperfect, and that we are to look for a more complete
     revelation; he dwelt with much earnestness on the danger of
     imagining that GOD'S peculiar protection of Christianity,
     GOD'S peculiar inward gifts to believers, ceased with the
     cessation of the outward signs and wonders which at first
     accompanied the revelation of His Word.

     John listened with great attention; and, when the Service was over,
     he thought long and deeply upon what had been said. He looked out
     also the different texts which the Doctor had mentioned in his
     Sermon; and in so doing he came to one which rather puzzled him. It
     was John xiv. 16. "It is strange," said he to himself: our LORD
     promised that the COMFORTER whom He would send, should abide with
     his followers for ever; I really do not see why this promise should
     be given, if the greatest and most striking gifts which that
     COMFORTER was to bestow, were to cease at the end of one, or at most
     of two generations."

     That evening, as he was strolling in the fine summer twilight along
     the banks of the river, he met the Doctor, who had walked that way
     to enjoy the fineness of the season, and to refresh himself after
     the holy labours of the day. He told him his difficulty, nearly in
     the words in which we have expressed it; and the Doctor, smiling
     good-naturedly, thus replied.

     Dr.---Are you quite sure, John, that you have stated your case
     aright? Is it perfectly certain that miraculous powers were the
     greatest gifts which the ETERNAL SPIRIT was commissioned to bestow
     upon mankind?

     J.---It certainly appeared to me that they were; such marked,
     such striking instances of God's favour were surely greater
     boons than any thing else which we can conceive to be given to
     mortals in this present life. I think, Sir, that I have heard you
     yourself call these gifts of the SPIRIT, as opposed to others, His
     extraordinary gifts.

     Dr.---You may very probably have heard me so call them; but
     "extraordinary" only means "unusual;" and it does not always follow
     that what is unusual is more important than what is of frequent
     occurrence. But tell me, John, in the case in which one thing is
     done in order to prepare for the doing of some other thing, which is
     the most important of the two; the first of these things or the
     last; the means or the end?

     J.---The end, of course, is more important than the means; no man
     would venture to call the scaffolding which is raised that the house
     may be built, more important than the house itself.

     Dr.---Now think a moment, John, before you answer me; why were
     the miraculous powers bestowed on the Apostles?

     J.---To make men believers in CHRIST.

     Dr.---To prepare the way, that is, for their receiving those in
     ward gifts of the SPIRIT, in which true believers now participate as
     fully as those who lived in the days of the Apostles.

     J.---I see, Sir; the extraordinary gifts might be compared to the
     scaffolding, the ordinary ones to the house.

     Dr.---Exactly so, John; marvellous and striking as were the signs
     and wonders of the Apostolic age, we should ever recollect that they
     were not greater gifts, or even gifts so great as those inward ones
     which are our evangelical inheritance, as well as that of the
     primitive Christians. When the doctrine of the HOLY GHOST, and of
     His inward influence, was new to the world, it pleased GOD to
     confirm it, and to show that the influence was real, by permitting,
     in some cases, those on whom it descended to perform works which
     they could not have done, had not God been with them. Thus the real
     importance, even then, of these miraculous gifts consisted in their
     bearing witness to the inward and unseen ones which GOD still
     showers upon His Church.

     J.---And which we dare not suppose to have ceased, merely because
     the outward signs of them did, when GOD Himself had promised that
     they should last for ever.

     Dr.---Well; the promise of support to the Apostles, in the
     performance of their ministerial duties, was equally perpetual;
     CHRIST was to be with them, we have seen, as the teachers and
     baptizers of all nations, "alway, even unto the end of the world."
     The reality of their powers, and, among others, of their power of
     conferring the HOLY GHOST on others, was attested at first by
     miracles. (Acts viii. 17, 18.) But we have no more reason for
     supposing that the true powers of the ministry ceased with the
     outward signs, in the case of the Apostles, than we have for
     supposing, in the case just mentioned of the gifts of common
     believers, that from the moment miracles were no longer vouchsafed,
     the HOLY SPIRIT withdrew Himself from the guidance of the Church for
     ever. That GOD has bestowed Apostolic gifts upon Apostles, and the
     regenerating influences of His HOLY GHOST upon other believers, we
     know from the recorded testimony of those who witnessed the miracles
     by which the reality of those gifts and influences was at first
     established. That those gifts and influences will be alike perpetual
     in the Church, we are bound to believe upon the solemn word of Him
     who gave them.

     J.---Miracles, then, performed in one age, and handed down by
     history to others, form the standing proofs of the reality of those
     gifts which were given to the church for ever; and one of those
     gifts was undoubtedly the Apostolic power; which we must believe,
     upon this evidence, to be still existing.

     Dr.---Exactly so; and infallibility of doctrine, itself a
     miracle, ceased with miracles in general. We cannot see any reason
     for the continuance of such a gift to the successors of the
     Apostles, when the Apostles themselves have recorded all things
     necessary to salvation in those sacred Scriptures, which have come
     down to our times, and to which we can all refer. Nor have we the
     slightest ground for doubting the permanence of those Apostolic
     privileges which were of perpetual necessity, merely because a
     miraculous gift, evidently no longer necessary, has been
     discontinued.

     J.---This, Sir, I understand; but there is one difficulty which
     occurs to me. As the rulers of the true Church are no longer in
     fallible, what is to prevent their all falling together into error,
     and thus leading astray the whole Church committed to their care?

     Dr.---We may infer from CHRIST'S promise already mentioned,
     that this will never happen to the whole Church at once; that some
     true Apostles will be found on earth in every age, until that last
     period of the world's history, which shall witness His coming.
     But that with regard to particular branches of His Church, this may
     happen, and has happened, is a melancholy truth. There is one simple
     test, however, by which we may at once assure our selves that the
     Church of England has not so fallen away, or, as it is called,
     apostatized from the faith of her Lord and Master.

     J.---And what is that, Sir?

     Dr.---As the eternal truth of GOD is contained in His revealed
     word, the Bible; no Church, whatever may be the errors of its
     individual members, can be said, as a Church, to have fallen away,
     and consequently to have lost her claim to the obedience of
     CHRIST'S true disciples, while she still reverences that
     Bible;---while she puts it into the hand of each of her
     followers, and bids him read it, and seek there, and there only, the
     proofs of the doctrine which she inculcates; and while she declares,
     as the Church of England does in her sixth Article, that "Holy
     Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation; so that
     whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to
     be required of any man that it should be believed as an article of
     the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation."

     J.---Then according to you, Sir, the Church of England is not
     only the true, but the original Church of CHRIST established in this
     kingdom.---Now Sam Jones, the Catholic, who attends the Popish
     Chapel in the next parish, tells me that his is the original Church,
     and that the Church of England is a new one.

     Dr.---That which is truly the Catholic Church, is indeed the
     oldest; but though we in a common way call the Papists, or followers
     of the Pope, Catholics yet it is we who are the true Catholics; for
     the term only means members of CHRIST'S universal Church. The
     history of the Papists is this. Many centuries ago, strange and
     corrupt notions and practices prevailed in many of the Churches in
     Europe. Among others, people thought the Pope or Bishop of Rome was
     gifted with authority from Heaven to controul all the branches of
     the Church on earth, and that his word was to be of more weight than
     even the Holy Scriptures themselves. But about three hundred years
     ago, the Bishops of the Church of England saw these errors in their
     true light; they saw that the Pope's authority was not founded
     on Scripture, and they consequently refused to acknowledge it, while
     they at the same time corrected, upon scriptural principles, the
     other errors and evil practices which I have alluded to. These
     changes did not make the Church of England a new Church, nor prevent
     that body which was CHRIST'S true and original Church before
     from being CHRIST'S true and original Church still. Some
     Bishops of that day, it is true, disapproved of these changes, and
     refused to accede to them; but as, when they died, they
     providentially appointed no successors, there has never since been
     any real ground for doubt which was the true Church of CHRIST in
     this favoured land. The Bishops of the Church of England, and they
     only, are the representatives by succession of those who, more than
     a thousand years ago, planted the Gospel on our shores [1].

     J.---But there are persons whom the Papists call their Bishops
     ---whence do they come?

     Dr.---They derive what they call their right from their
     appointment by foreign Bishops in an unauthorized manner. The Pope
     and his followers would by no means acknowledge the changes which
     had taken place in England; they declared that our Church had
     apostatized from the faith, and refused to communicate with us, till
     we should return to all our ancient errors They have since, upon the
     alleged ground that our line of Bishops was extinct, given
     commission from time to time to different persons to exercise
     episcopal authority here; but as the ground was false, the
     commission was of course void. We acknowledge the Pope and his
     Bishops in foreign countries to be, by station, ministers of the
     Church, though we admit and lament the fact, that they have led the
     branches of it over which they preside into apostasy and shame; yet
     we feel that in sending their representatives hither, to act in
     defiance of the Church already established, they are exceeding the
     limits of their authority. We feel that GOD, who is not the author
     of confusion, but of peace, in all churches of the saints, (1 Cor.
     xiv. 33.) cannot sanction the intrusion of one Bishop, however duly
     consecrated, into the See of another, with a view to the usurpation
     of his name and office, and to the organizing a systematic
     opposition to his authority. We are compelled there fore to regard
     those who are ordained, as Popish Priests are, by these intruding
     Bishops, as unauthorized and schismatical ministers of religion, and
     as violaters, like the other dissenters around them, of the laws of
     CHRIST'S Church, and of the unity of His fold.

     J.---I thank you, Sir, for giving me so good an answer to Sam
     when next I meet him. And I thank you, too, deeply and sincerely do
     I thank you, for teaching me the nature of one great branch of
     Christian duty which I never understood before. I seem now to see
     that there is a sin of which a Christian may be guilty, of which I
     never before thought; the sin, I mean, of refusing obedience to the
     command of our REDEEMER to hear His Apostles; to demean ourselves as
     dutiful members of the Church which those holy persons founded, and
     over which He Himself, invisibly, presides; a sin, of which they are
     deeply guilty who separate themselves from that Church altogether,
     and join one or other of the many sects which reject her authority.
     Pray, Sir, by what name is such a sin properly called?

     Dr.---It is called "schism," from a Greek word signifying
     "division." A man may forfeit the privileges enjoyed by him as a
     member of CHRIST'S Church in two ways:---either on account
     of "heresy," of his adopting opinions opposed to the great truths of
     the Word of GOD; or through schism, through a disregard of Church
     authority, and a notion that so long as his doctrine is pure, he may
     join what sect he pleases, or even set up one for himself. The
     exercise of such a privilege I have heard some people call
     "Christian Liberty."

     J. (smiling).---I understand you, Sir: but you shall hear me use
     the words in this improper sense no more. The true liberty where
     with CHRIST has made us free, is theirs alone, who in reverencing
     His ministers, walk in the way of His commandments. Admitting, as I
     now do, the force of what you have said; convinced, as I now am,
     that the Church of England is the Apostolic Church of CHRIST,
     established by our LORD Himself, I cannot but see that their sin is
     indeed great, who wilfully reject and despise it.

     Dr.---Such persons would do well to consider our SAVIOUR'S
     words to those Ministers whose successors they slight. "He that
     despiseth you, despiseth Me; and he that despiseth Me, despiseth Him
     that sent Me." (Luke x. 16.)

     J.---They would indeed, Sir; and I thank GOD that you have shown
     me the meaning of this text before I had completely separated myself
     from the Church to which my SAVIOUR has commanded me to belong. GOD
     knows, I meant to do no such thing when first my curiosity led me to
     the meeting.

     Dr.---I know it, John; but let me show you the danger of making
     the first step, of yielding to the first temptation. Curiosity led
     you to a place, to which, if you understood your duty, you had no
     business to go; you were pleased, and tempted to repeat your visit,
     and might soon have been led to unite yourself entirely to that
     unauthorized congregation; in defiance, as I have now shown you, of
     the solemnly declared will of the ALMIGHTY.

     J.---Well, Sir; I will, by GOD'S blessing, keep myself from
     such temptations for the future. I trust that on each succeeding
     Sunday, while life and health are spared me, I shall be found in my
     old accustomed seat at Church, and kneel in the sacred spot where my
     forefathers knelt before me: and GOD grant that no temptation may
     ever again lead me astray, or induce me to separate from the holy
     Church of my REDEEMER.

     Dr.---It gives me, John, the sincerest pleasure to hear you
     express such sentiments as these. One good effect will, through
     GOD'S grace, result even from this your temporary wandering
     from the fold. You will now know better than you did, what we mean
     when in the words of our Liturgy we pray for "the good estate of the
     Catholic Church;" and you will be enabled, I trust to join more
     fully than heretofore in the beautiful prayer, "that it may be so
     guided and governed by GOD'S good SPIRIT, that all who profess
     and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth, and
     hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in
     righteousness of life."

     J.---I hope, Sir, that I shall: I hope that I shall ever feel
     duly thankful for the blessing of being called into CHRIST'S
     Church, thus happily established among us; and I trust that when in
     the name of the congregation you put up the prayer for protection
     against "false doctrine, heresy, and schism," my heart and soul may
     accompany my lips in the response,---"Good LORD, deliver us !"

     OXFORD,

     The Feast of the Annunciation.

                                   FOOTNOTE

     [1] In the same manner it may be shown, that the established Church
     of Ireland alone represents that Church which the labours of St.
     Patrick, in the fifth century, planted in that island. Those who
     preside over the Romanists have received consecration from Rome, at
     a very recent period. And the corruptions which prevail in their
     religion, and which distinguish it from ours, became prevalent long
     after the Saint's death. Our doctrines therefore approach more
     nearly to his than theirs do; and our Church is the true and
     original Church of CHRIST in Ireland, in every sense which the words
     will bear.
