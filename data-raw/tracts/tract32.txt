                    THE STANDING ORDINANCES OF RELIGION.

                                 [Number 32]
     __________________________________________________________________

     MOST of us, perhaps, will find, upon examination, that we do not
     feel and act, as the Apostles and the early Church felt and acted,
     with regard to the Ordinances of our Religion. The reader is
     entreated to give this suggestion a fair consideration; not to hurry
     on, nor turn away from the recollection, that we shall all one day
     be judged, not merely by what we actually knew, but by what we might
     have known, respecting our duties to CHRIST and His Church. Let him
     consider, whether his own reason, and the Holy Scriptures, which
     were expressly written in order that we might possess full religious
     knowledge, do not say more on this subject than be has yet duly
     weighed and acted upon.

     First, consider what Reason says; which surely, as well as
     Scripture, was given us for religious ends.

     1. Can you possibly imagine any better method of perpetuating
     doctrines, than by ordinances, which live on like monuments?
     Consider, for instance, what is implied in Christian Salvation;
     remember whose property and subjects we are when we come into the
     world; and then endeavour, if you can, to estimate the value of
     those two Blessed Ordinances, which are the standing and definite
     publication, to every one of us, to our fathers, and our children,
     of the infinite mercies of GOD, as manifested in the Covenant of the
     Gospel. E. g. a generation of ungodly men (suppose) rise up and
     possess the earth; Satan, through their means; corrupts all that he
     can, in the world; but meantime, something is living on, in the very
     midst of them, independent of the variable opinions of the human
     mind; something, which they cannot spoil, and which, after they are
     gone to their account, and all their wretched folly has spent itself
     upon their own head, will come forth pure and unsullied, full of
     sweetness and edifying comfort to the remnant which shall then rise
     up, who will feed upon it by faith, and form anew the living temple
     of the HOLY GHOST, in their generation. Thus the consecrated Form of
     Religion will be like some fair statue, which lies buried for ages,
     but comes forth at length as beautiful as ever; they will be
     furnished with all requisites for teaching us those lessons, which
     the preceding age has been engaged in obliterating.

     2. If it be true that our weak and carnal minds do not readily dwell
     upon, nor comprehend, spiritual things by themselves, can we
     conceive any thing more precious to us on earth, than the outward
     forms which GOD Himself has appointed to arrest our attention, to
     embody unseen realities, to serve as a kind of ladder between earth
     and heaven, between our spirit and the Spirit of Holiness? It is
     much to our purpose to observe, that Almighty GOD Himself directly
     declares that this is His design, in the institution of Forms and
     Ordinances. And the consideration of such passages of Scripture may
     perhaps set us on asking ourselves whether we can be really desiring
     the end, if we find ourselves at all irregular in seeking the means
     which He has appointed. (Vide Exod. xii. 26. xiii. 5---10. and
     11---16. Levit. xxiii. 43. Josh. iv. 1---7.)

     3. Further, religious ordinances are, to the consciences of
     individuals, a recurring testimony against sin. Can we conceive any
     thing more precious in an ungodly world, in the perverse world of
     our own heart? Dare we then suffer to decay, and go to nought, the
     means which GOD has provided for calling sinners to repentance, and
     even the best men to self-examination? Shall we suffer ourselves to
     think and speak lightly of them, and neglect to defend them when
     they are attacked? To remove a barrier against error, is in its
     measure to encourage and tempt men to it; and comes under the
     denunciation pronounced by our Blessed LORD, (Luke xvii. 1, 2.) "Woe
     unto him through whom offences come; it were better for him that a
     millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than
     that he should make to stumble one of these little ones."

     Just the same care did GOD take of His peculiar people of old.
     "Write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel;
     put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for Me
     against the children of Israel. For when I shall have brought them
     into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with
     milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and
     waxed fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and
     provoke Me, and break My covenant. And it shall come to pass, when
     many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall
     testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out
     of the mouths of their seed." (Deut. xxxi. l9---21.)

     "Which of you," says Hooker, "receiveth a guest whom he honoureth,
     and whom he loveth, and doth not sweep his chamber against his
     coming? And shall we suffer the chambers of our hearts and
     consciences to lie full of vomiting, full of filth, full of garbage,
     knowing that CHRIST hath said, ;I and My Father will come and
     dwell with you ?'... Blessed and praised for ever and ever be
     His Name, who, perceiving of how senseless and heavy metal we are
     made, hath instituted in His Church a Spiritual Supper, and an Holy
     Communion, to be celebrated often, that we might thereby be
     occasioned often to examine these buildings of ours, in what case
     they stand. For sith GOD doth not dwell in temples which are
     unclean; sith a shrine cannot be a sanctuary to Him; and this Supper
     is received as a seal unto us, that we are His house and His
     sanctuary; that His CHRIST is as truly united unto me, and I to Him,
     as my arm is united and knit unto my shoulder; that He dwelleth in
     me as verily as the elements of bread and wine abide within me;
     which persuasion, by receiving these dreadful mysteries, we profess
     ourselves to have; a due comfort, if truly; and if in hypocrisy,
     then woe with us.

     4. These arguments, in behalf of the duty of keeping to the Standing
     Ordinances of Religion, are strengthened by the consideration of the
     peculiar influence which old and familiar institutions exert over
     the affections. If Christianity were left to select and reject its
     ordinances, as one age succeeded to another, there would be no
     safeguard for the permanence and identity of the religious temper
     itself. GOD indeed might invisibly preserve it; but so He might (did
     He so choose) without ordinances of any kind. But, since He has
     vouchsafed to employ them, it is but judging according to the
     revealed course of His Providence, to say, that His purpose is more
     fully answered by their being of a standing than of a variable
     nature. Thus we find an argument from the reason of the case, for
     rigidly adhering to those which have been transmitted to us.

     5. Consider for one moment what becomes of any of us, if we be not
     blest and supported with the Divine Grace; and then consider through
     what channels it is most natural to expect, and safest to seek this
     Grace: whether through Standing Ordinances, those to which the
     Church has ever had recourse as appointed by CHRIST and His
     Apostles, or those which we follow without inquiry as to their
     antiquity or acceptableness. The analogy of former dispensations
     leads us to the same conclusion. Abraham at Hebron (Gen. xv. 8, 9.)
     seeks a sign; Almighty GOD refers him to the usual ordinance of
     worship, sacrifice, and therein sends him a sign. So again, He might
     have revealed Himself to Moses in any place; but if Moses would find
     Him, it must be in the Tabernacle. Cornelius prayed and fasted,
     certainly not expecting a supernatural vision; but one was sent him,
     with the message of salvation. On the other hand, it is the
     peculiarity of false prophets and unsound teachers to seek change
     and novelty in the rites with which they approach GOD. "When Balaam
     saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not as at
     other times to seek for enchantments, but he set his face towards
     the wilderness." (Numb. xxiv. 1.) Accordingly he is obliged to speak
     with a wavering belief: "Peradventure the LORD will come to meet
     me."

     So much for what Reason suggests to us. Now let us observe what GOD
     Himself has directly told us in Scripture concerning Standing
     Religious Ordinances.

     1. He positively enjoins them. Turn to the Jewish ceremonies, and
     remember that they were, (1.) Often unintelligible in their full
     import, yet positively enjoined, even on pain of death. E. g.
     Circumcision (Gen. xvii. 14.), the Passover (Exod. xii. 15. Numb.
     ix. 13.) And remember that our faith and obedience are chiefly tried
     in things not understood, as, for instance, in the prohibition of
     the tree of knowledge. (2.) They were afterwards found to be
     significant. See the Epistle to the Hebrews throughout. Just as wise
     teachers store the minds of children with things which they will not
     fully understand till a future day, so does our Divine Master admit
     us to the Symbols of that eternal worship and service of Him, which
     shall constitute the blessedness of the next life, a blessedness
     which it hath not entered into man's heart to conceive. (3.)
     The ordinances-of the Christian Church are held in such high honour,
     that even to those whom He had first enriched with His miraculous
     gift, it was yet a farther and indispensable blessing to receive a
     solemn admission into her sacred mysteries. Mark, for instance, St.
     Peter's converts, Acts x. 44---48. They had received the
     HOLY GHOST, and spake with other tongues: "Then answered Peter, Can
     any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized which have
     received the HOLY GHOST as well as we? And he commanded them to be
     baptized in the name of the LORD." Vide also Acts xiii. 2, 3.

     2. GOD provided that the Jews should be able to keep His ordinances;
     rather interrupting the course of nature, and controlling the
     feelings of whole nations, than that the ordinances of His service
     should be set aside on a single occasion. If He commands the
     observance of the Sabbath in the wilderness, He provides for the
     people a double store of manna on the day before, and miraculously
     preserves it from corruption. (Exod. xvi. 5. 24.) If He directs that
     the land be allowed to lie fallow every seventh year, He sends a
     triple harvest in the sixth year. (Levit. xxv. 21.) If He enjoins
     all the males to leave their homes, and appear before Him thrice in
     the year, he suspends all the jealous and hostile feelings of the
     neighbouring nations, and promises that they should not even
     "desire" the land of the Israelites. (Exod. xxxiv. 24.)

     3. We cannot dare to conjecture how much evil may come from
     neglecting positive ordinances. King Saul departed from the express
     command of GOD, respecting the way in which sacrifice should be made
     to Him. He could even make a plausible excuse for what he did; but
     turn to l Sam. xiii. 13, and see what it drew down upon him: "Thou
     hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD
     thy GOD which He commanded thee; for now would the LORD have
     established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. But now thy kingdom
     shall not continue; the LORD hath sought Him a man after His own
     heart, and the LORD hath commanded Him to be captain over His
     people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded
     thee." Think again of Nadab and Abihu; they did not neglect the
     worship of GOD; but they thought they might surely take the fire for
     the sacrifice from whence they would; "surely this was a minor
     point," as some among us are presumptuous enough to say. But He who
     gave laws to them and us, knows nothing of minor points. There can
     be no little sin, for there is no little authority to sin against.
     Nadab and Abihu were struck dead for offering with strange fire.
     This is agreeable to the analogy of the physical world, which is
     open to our senses. It is a simple and apparently harmless thing to
     place a candle near gunpowder, or to bring certain gases together;
     but the result may cost us our life.

     4. Such was the importance of observing positive ordinances in the
     Jewish Church. Surely the lesson delivered in the Old Testament is
     intended for us Christians. We have the same unchanging Father, who
     was the GOD of Israel, and who has given us the Scriptures that we
     may have the means of searching out His will. First consider the
     light in which He views in the law of Moses what we are apt to call
     "minor points." "Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the
     Tabernacle of the Congregation day and night, seven days, and keep
     the charge of the Lord, that ye die not." (Levit. viii. 35.) After
     the death of Nadab and Abihu, the charge is given "unto Aaron, and
     unto Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither
     rend your clothes, lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the
     people." (Levit. x. 6.) "Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou
     nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the Tabernacle of the
     Congregation, lest ye die." (Ibid.)

     This was the uniform tone of the Divine Guardian of the Church then.
     Is the duty less urgent now? when, (1.) the added claim on our
     gratitude is all that the New Testament tells us. (2.) The
     Ordinances are so much fewer, and therefore, first, the trouble of
     them is so incomparably diminished; next, the preciousness of them
     (humanly speaking) so much more strikingly seen: they are the only
     jewels of this sort that we have left.

     5. Remark may be made upon the very circumstance, that, in the
     Christian Covenant, Standing Ordinances are made the channels of its
     peculiar blessings. The first use of Ordinances is that of
     witnessing for the Truth, as above mentioned. Now their sacramental
     character is perfectly distinct from this, and is doubtless a great
     honour put on them. Had we been left to conjecture, we might have
     supposed, that in the more perfect or spiritual system, the gifts of
     grace would rather have been attached to certain high moral
     performances; whereas they are deposited in mere positive
     ordinances, as if to warn us against dropping the ceremonial of
     Christianity.

     This last observation leads to the brief notice of an objection
     sometimes brought against the necessity of a Christian's
     attention to Ordinances, grounded on the notion of the spiritual
     character of Christianity. Now,---1. Are we quite sure that we
     are more spiritual, and more independent of the external helps of
     the Church, than Samuel,---Hezekiah,---Josiah,---and
     Daniel?--- 2. What does our own experience say? Do we see the
     best and holiest of men becoming most independent and regardless of
     them, or the very reverse? 3. Are the feelings of love, affection,
     reverence, tender remembrance, which are entertained to wards such
     places and things as are associated in our minds with the persons
     who are the primary objects of these feelings, inconsistent with
     spiritual-mindedness? Are not the Ordinances which Christ and His
     Apostles have appointed, the bond of perpetuated unity to the
     Church, a precious and mysterious medium for the "Communion of
     Saints" in all countries and ages? No one among us would think it a
     mark of weakness to cherish with attachment and respect a Bible
     which his father had used for half a century, from which he had
     learned the words of life and the way of salvation. And is it not a
     soothing and elevating privilege, to feel that we, even at this
     distant day, are allowed to come and walk in the very steps of all
     the holy men of old, the glorious company of the Apostles, and the
     noble army of martyrs, to take that narrow path, whose farther end
     they have now found to be in heaven? In walking over the very ground
     where the holy Apostles lived and walked as Bishops, or in following
     our LORD Himself into Gethsemane, along the beach of the sea of
     Gennesareth, or in pausing with Him on the Mount Olivet, as He weeps
     over Jerusalem, we find ourselves moved with some thing too deep and
     touching for words, and almost for thought; and is it no privilege,
     no blessing, to think with Him, to have our spirit admitted to move
     in the same path which His Holy Spirit hath chosen; to be
     consecrated with Him and to Him in the water of Baptism, to eat the
     Holy Supper with Him, to fast with Him, to pray with Him in the very
     form and very thoughts which flowed from His divine mind and lips?


     If these things are so, how can we hold up our heads, and dare-to
     think of the way in which we have handled His Ordinances, handled
     that Form in which He has deigned to live on in the world, and to
     move before the eyes of His Church! If we can recollect the moment
     when we have been so dead in heart as to have found ourselves
     considering, not how often our Saviour would let us come and hold
     communion with Him, but how few times would satisfy
     Him,---whether "this one" omission would draw down His
     displeasure,---if there be one of us who lives in this spirit,
     "how dwelleth the love of God in him?"

     Once more, if, when all times, all places, all forms are in
     themselves alike, yet it has pleased the High and Lofty One that
     inhabiteth eternity, whose Name is Holy, to choose to Himself
     certain forms, places, and times, for His especial dwelling upon
     earth,---with what reverend and solemn feelings should we go to
     meet Him there, and approach His altar with our gift! We read (Lev.
     xxii. 18. 25.) that the GOD of Israel would admit no blemished
     creature to be sacrificed to Him; nor will He now accept the
     offering of our hearts unless
     we cleanse ourselves from all unbelief, insincerity, and guile:
     "wash our hands in innocency, and so go to His altar."
