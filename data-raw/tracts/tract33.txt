                            PRIMITIVE EPISCOPACY.

                                 [Number 33]
     __________________________________________________________________

     IN primitive times the first step towards evangelizing a heathen
     country seems to have been to seize upon some principal city in it,
     commonly the civil metropolis, as a centre of operation; to place a
     Pastor, i. e. (generally) a Bishop there; so surround him with a
     sufficient number of associates and assistants; and then to wait,
     till, under the blessing of Providence, this Missionary College was
     able to gather around it the scattered children of grace from the
     evil world, and invest itself with the shape and influence of an
     organized Church. The converts would, in the first instance, be
     those in the immediate vicinity of the Missionary or Bishop,

     whose diocese nevertheless would extend over the heathen country on
     every side, either indefinitely, or to the utmost extent of the
     civil province; his mission being without restriction to all to whom
     Christian faith had never been preached. As he prospered in the
     increase of his flock, and sent out his clergy to greater and
     greater distances from the city, so would the homestead (so to call
     it) of his Church enlarge. Other towns would be brought under his
     government, openings would occur for stations in isolated places;
     till at length "the burden becoming too heavy for him he would
     appoint others to supply his place in this or that part of the
     province. To these he would commit a greater or lesser share of his
     spiritual power, as might be necessary; sometimes he would make them
     fully his representatives, or ordain them Bishops; at other times he
     would employ presbyters for his purpose. These assistants, or (as
     they were called) Chorepiscopi, would naturally be confined to their
     respective districts; and if Bishops, an approximation would
     evidently be made to a division of the large original diocese into a
     number of smaller ones connected with and subordinate to the Bishop
     of the metropolitan city. Thus, from the very Missionary character
     of the Primitive Church, there was a tendency in its polity to what
     was afterwards called the Provincial and Patriarchal system.

     It is not, indeed, to be supposed that this was the only way in
     which the graduated order of sees (so to call it) originated; but,
     at least, it is one way. And there is this advantage in remarking
     it: we learn from it, that large dioceses are the characteristics of
     a church in its infancy or weakness; whereas, the more firmly
     Christianity was rooted in a country, and the more vigorous its
     rulers, the more diligently were its sees multiplied throughout the
     ecclesiastical territory. Thus, St. Basil, in the fourth century,
     finding his exarchate defenceless in the neighbourhood of Mount
     Taurus, created a number of dioceses to meet the emergency. These
     subordinate sees may be called suffragan to the Metropolitan Church,
     whether the respective rulers were mere representatives of the
     Bishop who created them, i. e., Chorepiscopi: or, an the other hand,
     substantive authorities, sovereign within their own limits, though
     bound by external ties to each other and to their Metropolitan. The
     most perfect state of a Christian country would be, where there was
     a sufficient number of separate dioceses; the next to it, where
     there were Chorepiscopi, or Suffragan Bishops in the modern sense of
     the word.

     Few persons, who have not expressly examined the subject, are aware
     of the minuteness of the dioceses into which many parts of
     Christendom were divided in the first ages. Some Churches in Italy
     were more like our rural deaneries than what we now consider
     dioceses; being not above ten or twelve miles in extent, and their
     sees not above five or six miles from each other. Even now (or, at
     least, in Bingham's time) the kingdom of Naples contains 147
     sees, of which twenty are Archbishopricks. Asia Minor is 630 miles
     long, 210 broad; yet in this country there were almost 400 dioceses.
     Palestine is in length 160 miles, in breadth 120; yet the number of
     known dioceses amounted to 48. Again, in the province of Syria
     Secunda, the see of Larissa (e. g.) was about 14 miles from Apamea,
     Arethusa 16 from Epiphania. And so again, turning to the West,
     though the dioceses were generally larger, as partaking more of a
     Missionary character, yet we shall find in Ireland at one time from
     50 to 60 sees.

     Such was the character of the Primitive Regimen, where Christianity
     especially flourished in the zeal and number of its professors. But,
     where the country was mountainous or desert, the inhabitants scanty,
     or but partially Christian, it was considered advisable to leave all
     to the management of one chief Pastor, who appointed assistants to
     himself according to his discretion, as the circumstances of the
     times required. The office of these Chorepiscopi, or country
     Bishops, was to preside over the country clergy, inquire into their
     behaviour, and report to their principal; also to provide fit
     persons for the inferior ministrations of the Church. They had the
     power of ordaining the lower ranks of clergy, such as the readers,
     sub-deacons, and exorcists; they might ordain priests and deacons
     with the leave of the city Bishop, and administer the rite of
     confirmation; and were permitted to sit and vote in councils. Thus
     their office bore a considerable resemblance to that of our
     Archdeacons; except, of course, that they had the power of
     ordination; whereas the latter are only presbyters. And, in matter
     of fact, by such presbyters (visitors, as they were called) they
     were superseded in the course of the fourth and following centuries,
     till at length the Pope caused the order to be set aside almost
     altogether in the ninth.

     Little use was made of Suffragans during the middle ages; but, at
     the time of our Reformation, Archbishop Cranmer felt the deficiency
     of the English Church in respect of Bishopricks, and projected
     several measures to supply it. The most complete was that of
     increasing the number, of dioceses; availing himself of existing
     circumstances; he advised the King to apply the Abbey lands to the
     founding of twenty additional sees. Bishop Burnet gives some of the
     particulars of this attempt in the following passage:


     "On the 23d of May, in the session of Parliament, a bill was brought
     in by Cromwell for giving the King power to erect new bishoprics by
     his letters-patent. It was read that day for the first, second, and
     third time, and sent down to the Commons. The Preamble of it was,
     ;that it was known what slothful and ungodly life bad been led
     by those who were called religious. But that these houses might be
     converted to better uses; that GOD'S word might be better set
     forth; children brought up in learning; clerks nourished in the
     universities; and that old decayed servants might have livings; poor
     people might have almshouses to maintain them; readers of Greek,
     Hebrew, and Latin, might have good stipends; daily alms might be
     administered, and allowance might be made for mending of the
     highways, and exhibitions for ministers of the Church; for these
     ends, if the King thought fit to have more bishopricks or cathedral
     churches erected out of the rents of these houses, full power was
     given him to erect and found them, and to make rules and statutes
     for them, and such translations of sees, or divisions of them, as he
     thought fit.' In the same paper, there is a list of the sees
     which he intended to found; of which what was done afterwards came
     so far short, that I know nothing to which it can be so reasonably
     imputed, as the declining of Cranmer's interest at court, who
     had proposed the erecting the new cathedrals and sees, with other
     things mentioned in the preamble of the statute, as a great mean of
     reforming the Church." Some of the proposed additional dioceses are
     then enumerated; Essex, Hertford, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire,
     Oxford and Berkshire, Northampton and Huntingdon, Middlesex,
     Leicester and Rutland, Gloucestershire, Lancashire, Suffolk,
     Stafford and Salop, Nottingham and Derby, Cornwall. As to the means
     by which they were to be endowed, no opinion is here expressed on
     its lawfulness, as the present sketch is confined to the
     consideration of the spiritual part of the ecclesiastical system. It
     is scarcely necessary to add that Cranmer's views were partly
     realized, in the subsequent creation of the dioceses of Chester,
     Bristol, Glocester, Oxford, and Peterborough.


     The same prelate whose episcopate has had so important an influence
     upon the constitution of our Church ever since, also projected with
     great wisdom, a system of suffragan bishops or Chorepiscopi, which
     he was able to bring into effect, and which lasted till the reign of
     King James. Twenty-six such bishops were appointed; the bishop of
     the diocese having the power of presenting two persons to the king,
     who might choose either of them, and present them to the archbishop
     of the province for consecration. These suffragans exercised such
     jurisdiction as their principal gave them, or as had formerly been
     committed to suffragans; their authority lasting no longer than he
     continued their commission to them. "These were believed," says
     Burnet "to be the same with the Chorepiscopi in the primitive
     church; which, as they were begun before the first council of Nice,
     so they continued in the Western Church till the 9th century, and
     then a decretal of Damascus being forged, that condemned them, they
     were put down every where by degrees, and now revived in England.
     The suffragan sees were as follows: Thetford, Ipswich, Colchester,
     Dover, Guilfold, Southampton, Taunton, Shaftsbury, Molton,
     Marlborough, Bedford, Leicester, Gloucester, Shrewsbury, Bristol,
     Penrith, Bridgwater, Nottingham, Grantham, Hull, Huntingdon,
     Cambridge, Pereth, Berwick, St. Germain's, and the Isle of
     Wight."

     After the disuse of suffragans in the reign of James I. there was a
     fresh project for establishing them on the Restoration. Charles, in
     one of his declarations, promises to increase the number of bishops,
     in accordance with Archbishop Ussher's plan for episcopal
     government. However, his intention was not put into execution,
     doubtless owing to existing circumstances, which reasonably
     interfered with it.

     The following extract is made from Bingham, Antiqu. ix. 8, "One
     great objection against the present diocesan episcopacy, and that
     which to many may look the most plausible, is drawn from the vast
     extent and greatness of most of the northern dioceses of the world,
     which makes it so extremely difficult for one man to discharge all
     the offices of the episcopal function . . . The Church of England
     has usually followed the larger model, and had very great and
     extensive dioceses; for at first she had but seven bishopricks in
     the whole nation, and those commensurate in a manner to the seven
     Saxon kingdoms. Since that time she has thought it a point of wisdom
     to contract her dioceses, and multiply them into above 20; and if
     she should think fit to add 40 or 100 more, she would not be without
     precedent in the practice of the Primitive Church. In Ireland there
     are not now above half the number of dioceses that there were
     before, and consequently they must needs be larger by uniting them
     together. In England, there are more in number than formerly, some
     new ones being created out of old ones, and at present the whole
     number augmented to three times as many as they were for some ages
     after the first conversion. Besides that, we have another way of
     contracting dioceses in effect here in England appointed by law,
     which law was never yet repealed; which is by devolving part of the
     bishop's care upon the Chorepiscopi, or suffragan bishops, as
     the law calls them:-a method commonly practised in the ancient
     Church in such large dioceses as those of St. Basil and Theodoret,
     one of which had no less than fifty Chorepiscopi under him, if
     Nazianzen rightly informs us. And it is a practice which was
     continued here all the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and even to the end
     of King James; and is what may be revived again, whenever any bishop
     thinks his diocese too large, or his burden too great to be
     sustained by himself alone."

     To the above statements, may be subjoined the present number of
     souls, and the area of square miles, in certain of our dioceses, as
     given in a pamphlet lately published, which has come into the
     writers hands since the foregoing was put on paper. (Vide Plan for a
     New Arrangement, &c. by Lord Henley.)

                                      Souls.                 Square
     Miles.

     Chester ...................1,806,722                 4140

     London ...................1,676,725                 1942

     York .......................1,526,288                 5300

     Lincoln .................... 920,011                 5775

     Lichfield................... 978,655                 3344

     By this table, it is not here intended to insinuate the necessity of
     any immediate measure of multiplying the English sees or appointing
     suffragans, (the expediency of which is to be determined by a
     variety of considerations, which it were unprofitable here to
     detail,) but to show that the genius of our ecclesiastical system
     tends towards such an increase, and that the only question to be
     determined is one of time. These statements are also made with the
     view of keeping up in the minds of churchmen a recollection of the
     injury which the Irish branch of our Church has lately sustained in
     the diminution of its sees.

     OXFORD.

     The Feast of SS. Philip and St. James.

     P. S.-Since this was written, a new arrangement of Dioceses and Sees
     has been made by authority of a Royal Commission, composed of
     members the greater part of whom were laymen, and without
     confirmation of their acts on the part of the Church.
