                      RITES AND CUSTOMS OF THE CHURCH.

                                 [Number 34]

     He who is duly strengthened in faith, does not go so far as to
     require argument and reason for what is enjoined, but is satisfied
     with the tradition alone.

     Chrysost. in 1 Cor. Hom. 26.
     __________________________________________________________________

     THE reader of ecclesiastical history is sometimes surprised at
     finding observances and customs generally received in the Church at
     an early date, which have not express warrant in the Apostolic
     writings; e. g. the use of the cross in baptism. The following pages
     will be directed to the consideration of this circumstance; with a
     view of suggesting from those writings themselves, that a minute
     ritual was contemporaneous with them, that the Apostles recognise it
     as existing and binding, that it was founded on religious
     principles, and tended to the inculcation of religious truth. Not
     that any formal proof is attainable or conceivable, considering the
     brevity and subjects of the inspired documents; but such fair
     evidence of the fact, as may recommend it to the belief of the
     earnest and single-minded Christian. It is abundantly evident that
     the Epistles were not written to prescribe and enforce the Ritual of
     religion; all then we can expect, if it existed in the days of the
     Apostles, is an occasional allusion to it in their Epistles as
     existing, and a plain acquiescence in it: and thus much we find.

     Let us consider that remarkable passage, (l Cor. xi. 2---16.)
     which, I am persuaded, most readers pass over as if they could get
     little instruction from it. St. Paul is therein blaming the
     Corinthians for not adhering to the custom of the Church, which
     prescribed that men should wear their hair short, and that women
     should have their head covered during divine service; a custom
     apparently most unimportant, if any one ever was, but in his view
     strictly binding on Christians. He begins by implying that it is one
     out of many rules or traditions ([Greek text: paradoseis]) which he
     had given them, and they were bound to keep. He ends by refusing to
     argue with any one who obstinately cavils at it and rejects it: "If
     any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the
     Churches of GOD." Here then at once a view is opened to us which is
     quite sufficient to remove the surprise we might otherwise feel at
     the multitude of rites, which were in use in the Primitive Church,
     but about which the New Testament is silent; and further, to command
     our obedience to such as come down to us from the first ages, and
     are agreeable to Scripture.

     In accordance with this conclusion, is the clear and forcible
     command given by the Apostle, (2 Thess. ii. 15.) "Brethren, stand
     fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by
     word, or our epistle."

     To return. St. Paul goes on to give the reason of the usage, for the
     satisfaction of the weak brethren at Corinth. It was, he implies, a
     symbol or developement (so to say) of the principle of the
     subordination of the woman to the man, and a memorial of the history
     of our creation; nay it was founded in "nature," i e. natural
     reason. And lastly, it had a practical object: the woman ought to
     have her head covered "because of the angels." We need not stop to
     inquire what this reason was; but it was a reason of a practical
     nature which the Corinthians understood, though we may not. If it
     mean, as is probable, "because she is in the sight of the heavenly
     angels," (1 Tim. v. 21.) it gives a still greater importance to the
     ceremonies of worship, as connecting them with the unseen world.

     It would seem indeed as if the very multiplicity of the details of
     the Church ritual made it plainly impossible for St. Paul to write
     them all down, or to do more than remind the Corinthians of his way
     of conducting religious discipline when he was among them. "Be ye
     followers of me;" he says, "I praise you that ye remember me in all
     things." It is evident there are ten thousand little points in the
     working of any large system, which a present instructor alone can
     settle. Hence it is customary at present, when a school is set up,
     or when any novel manufacture in trade, or extraordinary machinery,
     is to be brought into use, to set it going by sending a person fully
     skilled in its practical details. Such was St. Paul as regards the
     system of Christian discipline and worship; and when he could not go
     himself, he sent Timothy in his place. He says in the 4th chapter:
     "I beseech you, be ye followers of me. For this cause have I sent
     unto you Timotheus, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways
     which be in CHRIST, as I teach every where in every Church." Here
     there is a like reference to an uniform system of discipline,---
     whether as to Christian conduct, worship, or Church government.

     Another important allusion appears to be contained in the 22nd verse
     of the chapter above commented on. "What, have ye not houses to eat
     and drink in? or despise ye the Church of GOD ?" This is remarkable
     as being a solitary allusion in Scripture to houses of prayer under
     the Christian system, which nevertheless we know from ecclesiastical
     history were used from the very first. Here then is a most solemn
     ordinance of primitive Christianity, which barely escapes, if it
     escapes, omission in Scripture.

     A passing allusion is made in another passage of the same Epistle,
     to the use of the word Amen at the conclusion of the Eucharistical
     prayer, as it is preserved after it and all other prayers to this
     day. Thus the ritual of the Apostles descended to minutiae, and
     these so invariable in their use, as to allow of an appeal to them.

     In the original institution of the Eucharist, as recorded in the
     Gospels, there is no mention of consecrating the cup; but in 1 Cor.
     x. 16, St. Paul calls it "the cup of blessing, which we bless." This
     incidental information, vouchsafed to us in Scripture, should lead
     us to be very cautious how we put aside other usages of the early
     Church concerning this sacrament, which do not happen to be clearly
     mentioned in Scripture; as e. g. the solemn offering of the elements
     to GOD by way of pleading His mercy through CHRIST, which seems to
     have been universal in the Church, till Popery corrupted it.

     As regards the same Sacrament, let us consider the use of the word
     [Greek text: leitourgounton], ministering, (Acts xiii. 2.); a word
     which, dropt (so to say) by accident, and interpreted, as is
     reasonable, by its use in the services of the Jewish Law, (I.uke i.
     23; Heb. x. 11.) remarkably coincides with the [Greek text:
     leitourgia] of the Primitive Church, according to which the offering
     of the Altar was intercessory, as pleading CHRIST'S merits
     before the throne of grace.

     Again, in 1 Cor. xv. 29, we incidentally discover the existence of
     persons who are styled "the baptized for the dead." Perhaps it is
     impossible to determine what is meant by this phrase, on which
     little light is thrown by early writers. However, any how it seems
     to refer to a custom of the Church, which was so usual as to admit
     of an appeal to it, which St. Paul approved, yet which he did not in
     the Epistle directly enforce, and but casually mentions.

     In 1 Cor. i. 16, St. Paul happens to inform us that he baptized the
     household of Stephanus. It has pleased the HOLY SPIRIT to preserve
     to us this fact; by which is detected the existence of a rule of
     discipline for which the express doctrinal parts of Scripture afford
     but indirect warrant, viz. the custom of household baptism. (Vid.
     also Acts xvi. 15. 33.) This accidental disclosure accurately
     anticipates the after practice of the early Church, according to
     which families, infants included, were baptized, and that on a
     weighty doctrinal reason; viz. that all men were born in sin and in
     the wrath of GOD, and needed to be individually translated into that
     kingdom of grace, into which baptism is the initiation.

     These instances, then, not to notice others of a like or a different
     kind, are surely sufficient to reconcile us to the complete ritual
     system which breaks upon us in the writings of the Fathers. If any
     parts of it indeed are contrary to Scripture, that is of course a
     decisive reason at once for believing them to be additions and
     corruptions of the original ceremonial; but till this is shown, we
     are bound to venerate what is certainly primitive, and probably is
     apostolic.

     It will be remarked, moreover, that many of the religious
     observances of the early Church are expressly built upon words of
     Scripture, and intended to be a visible memorial of them, after the
     manner of St. Paul's directions about the respective habits of
     men and women, which was just now noticed. Metaphorical or mystical
     descriptions were represented by a corresponding literal action. Our
     LORD Himself authorised this procedure when He took up the metaphor
     of the prophets concerning the fountain opened for our cleansing
     (Zech. xiii. l.) and represented it in the visible rite of baptism.
     Accordingly, from the frequent mention of oil in Scripture as the
     emblem of spiritual gifts, (Is. lxi. 1---3, &c.) it was actually
     used in the Primitive Church in the ceremony of admitting
     catechumens, and in baptizing. And here again they had the precedent
     of the Apostles, who applied it in effecting their miraculous cures.
     (Mark vi. 13. James v. 14.) And so from the figurative mention in
     Scripture of salt, as the necessary preparation of every religious
     sacrifice, it was in use in the Western Church, in the ceremony of
     admitting converts into the rank of catechumens. So again from Phil.
     ii. 10, it was customary to bow the head at the name of JESUS. It
     were endless to multiply in stances of a similar pious attention to
     the very words of Scripture, as their custom of continual public
     prayer from such passages as Luke xviii. 7; or of burying the bodies
     of martyrs under the altar, from Rev. vi. 9; or of the white
     vestments of the officiating ministers, from Rev. iv. 4.

     Two passages on the subject from the Fathers shall now be laid
     before the reader, by way of further illustration, and first from
     Tertullian:

     "Though this observance has not been determined by any text of
     Scripture, yet it is established by custom, which doubtless is
     derived from Apostolic tradition. For how can an usage ever obtain,
     which has not first been given by tradition? But you say, even
     though tradition can be produced, still a written (Scripture)
     authority must be demanded. Let us examine, then, how far it is
     true, that an Apostolic tradition itself, unless written in
     Scripture, is inadmissible. Now I will give up the point at once, if
     it is not already determined by instances of other observances,
     which are maintained without any Scripture proof, on the mere plea
     of tradition, and the sanction of consequent custom. To begin with
     baptism. Before we enter the Water, we solemnly renounce the devil,
     his pomp, and his angels, in church in the presence of the Bishop.
     Then we are plunged in the water thrice, and answer certain
     questions over and above what the LORD has determined in the written
     gospel. After coming out of it, we taste a mixture of milk and
     honey; and for a whole week from that day we abstain from our daily
     bath. The sacrament of the Eucharist, though given by the LORD to
     all and at supper time, yet is celebrated in our meetings before day
     break, and only at the hand of our presiding ministers .. We sign
     our forehead with the cross whenever we set out and walk, go in or
     out, dress, gird on our sandals, bathe, eat, light our lamps, sit or
     lie down to rest, whatever we do. If you demand a scripture rule for
     these and such like observances, we can give you none; all we say to
     you is, that tradition directs, usage sanctions, faith obeys. That
     reason justifies this tradition, usage, and faith, you will soon
     yourself see, or will easily learn from others; meanwhile you will
     do well to believe that there is a law to which obedience is due. I
     add one instance from the old dispensation. It is so usual among the
     Jewish females to veil their head, that they are even known by it. I
     ask where the law is to be found; the Apostle's decision of
     course is not to the point. Now if I no where find a law, it follows
     that tradition introduced the custom, which after wards was
     confirmed by the Apostle when he explained the reason of it. These
     instances are enough to show that a tradition, even though not in
     Scripture, still binds our conduct, if a continuous usage be
     preserved as the witness of it."---Tertullian, de Coron. S 3.

     Upon this passage it may be observed, that Tertullian, flourishing
     A. D. 200, is on the one hand a very early witness for the existence
     of the general doctrine which it contains, while on the other he
     gives no sanction to those later customs, which the Church of Rome
     upholds, but which cannot be clearly traced to primitive times.

     St. Basil, whose work on the HOLY SPIRIT, S 66, shall next be cited,
     flourished in the middle of the fourth century, 150 years after
     Tertullian, and was of a very different school; yet he will be found
     to be in exact agreement with him on the subject before us, viz.
     that the ritual of the Church was derived from the Apostles, and was
     based on religious principles and doctrines. He adds a reason for
     its not being given us in Scripture, which we may receive or reject
     as our judgment leads us, viz. that the rites were memorials of
     doctrines not intended for publication except among baptized
     Christians, whereas the Scriptures were open to all men. This at
     least is clear, that the ritual could scarcely have been given in
     detail in Scripture, without imparting to the Gospel the character
     of a burdensome ceremonial, and withdrawing our attention from its
     doctrines and precepts.

     "Of those articles of doctrine and preaching, which are in the
     custody of the Church, some come to us in Scripture itself, some are
     conveyed to us by a continuous tradition in mystical depositories.
     Both have equal claims on our devotion and are received by all, at
     least by all who are in any respect Churchmen. For, should we
     attempt to supersede the usages which are not enjoined in Scripture
     as if unimportant, we should do most serious injury to Evangelical
     truth; nay, reduce it to a bare name. To take an obvious instance;
     which Apostle has taught us in Scripture to sign believers with the
     cross? Where does Scripture teach us to turn to the east in prayer?
     Which of the saints has left us recorded in Scripture the words of
     invocation at the consecration of the bread of the Eucharist, and of
     the cup of blessing? Thus we are not content with what Apostle or
     Evangelist has left on record, but we add other rites before and
     after it, as important to the celebration of the mystery, receiving
     them from a teaching distinct from Scripture. Moreover, we bless the
     water of baptism, and the oil for anointing, and also the candidate
     for baptism himself......After the example of Moses, the Apostles
     and Fathers who modelled the Churches, were accustomed to lodge
     their sacred doctrine in mystic forms, as being secretly and
     silently conveyed...This is the reason why there is a tradition of
     observances independent of Scripture, lest doctrines, being exposed
     to the world, should be so familiar as to be despised......We stand
     instead of kneeling at prayer on the Sunday; but all of us do not
     know the reason of this. Again, every time we kneel down and rise
     up, we show by our outward action, that sin has levelled us with the
     ground, and the loving mercy of our Creator has recalled us to
     heaven."

     The conclusion to be drawn from all that has been said in these
     pages is this:---That rites and ordinances, far from being
     unmeaning, are in their nature capable of impressing our memories
     and imaginations with the great revealed verities; far from being
     superstitious, are expressly sanctioned in Scripture as to their
     principle, and delivered to the Church in their form by tradition.
     Further, that they varied in different countries, according to the
     respective founder of the Church in each. Thus e.g., St. John and
     St. Philip are known to have adopted the Jewish rule for observing
     Easter-day; while other Apostles celebrated it always on a Sunday.
     Lastly, that, although the details of the early ritual varied in
     importance, and corrupt additions were made in the middle ages, yet
     that, as a whole, the Catholic ritual was a precious possession; and
     if we, who have escaped from Popery, have lost not only the
     possession, but the sense of its value, it is a serious question
     whether we are not like men who recover from some grievous illness
     with the loss or injury of their sight or hearing;---whether we
     are not like the Jews returned from captivity, who could never find
     the rod of Aaron or the Ark of the Covenant, which, indeed, had ever
     been his from the world, but then was removed from the Temple
     itself.
