            THE PEOPLE'S INTEREST IN THEIR MINISTER'S COMMISSION.

                                 [Number 35]
     __________________________________________________________________

     And I will give unto thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven: and
     whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and
     whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.
     (Matt. xvi. 19.)

     In these words our blessed Lord delivers to St. Peter the same
     commission, as we find Him, in chapter xviii. of the same Gospel,
     giving to the rest of the apostles; the commission, power, and
     authority of chief shepherds, or pastors to the Church;-the
     commission to be the keepers and guardians of the revealed word of
     God, and to have authority to teach the people out of it, and what
     they must do to be saved, what course of faith and duty will admit
     them to heaven, through the sacrifice of Christ; and what will
     exclude them from all claim to the salvation which He has purchased
     for man. It is to this part of the commission that St. Paul alludes
     when he says, "As we have been allowed of God to be put in trust
     with the Gospel, so we speak not as pleasing men, but God which
     trieth our hearts" (1 Thess. ii. 4.); and again he says, "we are
     ambassadors for CHRIST, as though GOD did beseech you by us." (2
     Cor. v. 20.)

     But something beyond the ministration of the Word, is committed to
     the care of the pastors, when our LORD speaks of "the keys of
     heaven," viz. the ministration of the sacraments. The sacrament of
     Baptism, by which souls are admitted into covenant with God, and
     without which none can enter into the kingdom of heaven (John iii.
     5.); the sacrament of the Body and Blood of CHRIST, by which the
     souls of the faithful are strengthened for their LORD'S service, and
     brought into union with Him (1 Cor. x. 16.), and without which they
     are, ordinarily speaking, cut off from union with Him, from
     communion with the faithful, and cast out of the Kingdom of Heaven.
     For it is expressly said, "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of
     Man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you." (John vi. 53.)
     St. Paul also tells us, that the ministration of these sacraments is
     entrusted to the pastors of the Church by this commission, when he
     says, "Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of CHRIST,
     and stewards of the mysteries of God." (1 Cor. iv. 1.)

     This commission, which you find in chapter xvi. given to St. Peter,
     and in chapter xviii. given to all the Apostles,-which is made
     mention of in St. Luke's Gospel, where our SAVIOUR says to them, "I
     appoint unto you a kingdom, as My Father hath appointed unto Me"
     (Luke xxii. 29.), and again in St. John's, where CHRIST says, "As My
     Father hath sent Me, even so send I you" (John xx. 21);-this
     commission, I say, was left by the apostles to their successors,
     viz. those apostles or bishops whom they appointed to be their
     helpers in governing the churches during their life-time, and to
     occupy their place when dead. And it has been handed down, by the
     laying on of hands, from bishops to bishops, and will so continue to
     the end of time, according to that promise, whereby our LORD engaged
     to continue with them always in the exercise of it, when He said to
     the apostles, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
     world." (Matt. xxviii. 20.) By virtue of this commission, each
     bishop stands in the place of an apostle of the Church; and
     discharges the important trust reposed in him, either in his own
     person, or by the clergy whom he ordains and gifts with a share of
     his authority.

     Herein is the difference between the ministry of such persons as
     have received this commission from the bishop, and of those who have
     not received it;-that to the former, CHRIST has promised that his
     presence shall remain, "Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of
     the world:" and that when they minister the Word and Sacraments
     (which are the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven), what they do upon
     earth, in His name, according to His will, shall be ratified and
     made good in heaven. "Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be
     bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be
     loosed in heaven." But to those who have not received the
     commission, our LORD has given no such promise. A person not
     commissioned from the bishop, may use the words of Baptism, and
     sprinkle or bathe with the water, on earth, but there is no promise
     from Christ, that such a man shall admit souls to the Kingdom of
     Heaven. A person not commissioned may break bread, and pour out
     wine, and pretend to give the LORD'S Supper, but it can afford no
     comfort to any who receive it at his hands, because there is no
     warrant from CHRIST to lead communicants to suppose that while he
     does so here on earth, they will be partakers in the SAVIOUR'S
     heavenly Body and Blood. And as for the person himself, who takes
     upon himself without warrant to minister in holy things, he is all
     the while treading in the footsteps of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
     whose awful punishment you read of in the book of Numbers. (Compare
     Number xvi. with Jude 11.)

     It is of the utmost importance that you should know and understand
     that it is by virtue of this commission, that we Clergymen lay claim
     to your attention, when we minister the Word and Sacraments. It is
     not because we have received an expensive education; it is not
     because we move in the station of what is called gentlemen; it is
     not because we have hitherto been encouraged by the State; it is not
     because we, most of us, have enough of this world's goods, both to
     supply our own wants, and to impart to the necessities of others; it
     is not for these things that we dare to speak to you in the name of
     GOD. Time was when the clergy had them not; the time may come again
     when they shall not have them. Men may rudely and unjustly taken
     away these things; may make us as poor as the poorest; may destroy
     what is called our station in society; may make us appear ion the
     eyes of men a humbled and degraded class, as they did the Apostles;
     may "cast out our name as evil for the SON of MAN'S sake," as they
     did theirs. This cannot alter our position in spiritual things, nor
     the relation which we bear to GOD and CHRIST, and to your souls. Men
     cannot take away what CHRIST has given us,-I mean the Divine
     commission; they cannot set aside the trust which He has placed in
     our hands,-I mean "the ministry of reconciliation" (2 Cor. v. 18.),
     nor make void the promise He has made, that in the faithful exercise
     of this ministry, He is "with us always, even to the end of the
     world."

     Remember, then, that whether your pastors be rich or poor, honoured
     or despised by the world, it is only the having received this
     COMMISSION that makes us "bold in our GOD to speak unto you the
     Gospel of GOD" (1 Thess. ii. 2.); and it is only this that can give
     you any security that the ministration of the Word and Sacraments
     shall be effectual to the saving of your souls. Learn, then, to
     cherish and value the blessing which GOD has vouchsafed to you, in
     having given you pastors who have received this commission. The
     Dissenting teachers have it not. They lay no claim to regular
     succession from the Apostles; and though the Roman Catholic clergy
     have indeed been ordained by the hands of Bishops, they are mere
     intruders in this country, have no right to come here, and besides,
     have so corrupted the truth of GOD'S word, that they are not to be
     listened to for a moment.
