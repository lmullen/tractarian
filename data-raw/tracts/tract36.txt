         ACCOUNT OF RELIGIOUS SECTS AT PRESENT EXISTING IN ENGLAND.

                                 [Number 36]
     __________________________________________________________________

     "I beseech you, brethren, mark them whcih cause divisions and
     offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid
     them."

     Rom. xvii. 17.
     __________________________________________________________________

     IT is conceived, that many members of the English Church, whom late
     events have awakened to a knowledge of the religious differences
     which exist in the world, are but insufficiently acquainted with the
     chief points which distinguish the various religious bodies which
     are among them; and may be anxious for information on the subject.
     The following statement, drawn up by a Clergyman at the request of a
     parishioner, is submitted to their consideration.

     The English Church, which is a true branch or portion of the "One
     Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church" of Christ, receives and
     teaches the entire Truth of God according to the Scriptures; the
     Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth. This may be
     proved by reference to the Scriptures; in which no fundamental
     doctrine can be pointed out, which the Church does not teach: nor
     can it be shown that the Church teaches any thing, as necessary to
     salvation, but what is contained in the Scriptures, or can be proved
     by them,---this being the acknowledged rule of teaching set forth
     in the 6th Article of the Church.

     The parties which are separated from, and opposed to, the Church,
     may be arranged into three classes. 1. Those who reject the Truth.
     2. Those who receive and teach a part, but not the whole, of the
     Truth. 3. Those who teach more than the Truth.

                     I.---Those who reject the Truth.

     Under this head are included all who deny that JESUS "is the CHRIST,
     the SON of the living GOD, and that salvation is through His blood.
     Such are

     1. SOCINIANS, (so called from Socinus, a chief teacher of their
     error), who profess to receive the Old and New Testament, but reject
     these fundamental doctrines as there set forth, and reject also the
     doctrine of the Personality and operations of the Holy Ghost. These
     men commonly call themselves Unitarians.

     2. JEWS, who profess to receive the Old Testament, but denounce our
     LORD as an Impostor. These contradict the Prophets of the Old
     Testament, to whose evidence our LORD appealed while fulfilling
     their prophecies 3 and they forget the living witness they
     themselves afford to our SAVIOUR'S truth, who foretold
     concerning their Church and nation, the evils which have since
     happened, and under which they are now suffering.

     3. DEISTS (SO called from professing to acknowledge merely a Deity),
     who reject both the Testaments, denying that GOD has ever revealed
     His will to men. Thus they contradict reason, which suggests that He
     would not leave the beings whom He created capable of happiness,
     without instruction how to attain that happiness: they contradict
     also the unanswerable evidence of history, miracles, and fulfilment
     of prophecy, which prove that He actually has revealed His Will, and
     that the Book which we call the Bible contains that Revelation.

     4. ATHEISTS (i. e. men "without God"), who deny altogether the
     existence of a GOD. These contradict the voice of nature, which, by
     the regularity of seasons, the succession, growth, and decay, of
     plants, of animals, and men, by the course of the planets and all
     its other wonderful works, attest the existence, power, and goodness
     of a Superior Being, who must have made all these things at the
     first, and now continues and preserves them.

     These four Classes may be placed together, because to all four the
     same passage of St. John is applicable. "Whosoever denieth the SON,
     the same hath not the FATHER," and of all four it may be truly said,
     "They have trodden under foot the SON of GOD, and counted the blood
     of the Covenant an unholy thing, and done despite to the Spirit of
     Grace."

     II.---Those who receive and teach a part but not the whole of the
        truth, erring in respect of one or more fundamental doctrines.

     Under this head are included most of what are called "Protestant
     Dissenters." The chief of these are,---

     1. PRESBYTERIANS, SO called from maintaining ;the validity of
     ordination by Presbyters or Elders only, in other words, by the
     second order of the clergy, dispensing with and superseding the
     first.

     2. INDEPENDENTS, SO called from being opposed to and independent of
     all ecclesiastical government.

     3. METHODISTS (subdivided into an immense variety of sects; the
     chief are Wesleyans, Whitfieldians, or Lady Huntingdon's,
     Ranters, or Primitive Methodists, Brianites, or Bible Christians,
     Protestant Methodists, Tent Methodists, Independent Methodists, and
     Kilhamites).

     These three do not receive or teach the Truth respecting the
     doctrine of "laying on of hands," which St. Paul classes among the
     fundamental doctrines of Christianity, and by which the Christian
     ministry receives its commission and authority to ad minister the
     Word and Sacraments. For they one and all reject the first (i. e.
     the Apostolic, or, as we now call it, Episcopal) order of clergy,
     who exercised that rite according to the New Testament, and without
     whom there is no warrant from Scripture for believing that the
     Clergy can be appointed, or the Sacraments be duly administered.

     4. BAPTISTS, who have departed from the Truth not only as concerns
     the doctrine of "laying on of hands," but also as concerns the
     doctrine of Baptism; another of the fundamental doctrines, according
     to St. Paul. For they refuse to permit their children to receive
     that sign of admission into the Christian covenant. Thus they
     contradict the Old Testament, for there we find that to the
     Christian Covenant, or Covenant in Christ, which God confirmed with
     Abraham, children were enjoined to be admitted; and those children
     whose parents withheld them from receiving the sign of the covenant,
     were counted by God to have broken His covenant. They contradict
     also the New Testament, for there our Saviour says, "Suffer little
     children to come unto me and forbid them not;" and St. Paul declares
     that where either parent is a believer, then "are the children
     holy," i. e. admissible to the covenant of grace.

     5. QUAKERS, who reject altogether laying on of hands, and both the
     Sacraments.

     Besides these are, especially in Wales, JUMPERS and SHAKERS, a chief
     part of whose religious worship consists in violent exercise and
     contortions of the body.

                III.---Those who teach more than the truth.

     Under this head are included all who teach besides the Scriptures,
     something else as of equal authority with what is contained in them.
     The chief of these are,---

     1. ROMANISTS, or PAPISTS, (so called because they are the followers
     of the Pope or Bishop of Rome,) who teach that the images of God and
     of the Saints ought to be worshipped; that the Virgin Mary and other
     Saints ought to be prayed to; that in the Lord's Supper, after
     consecration, the bread is no longer bread, the wine no longer wine;
     that all Churches owe obedience to the Pope of Rome, &c. &c. They
     have at different times attempted to confirm these doctrines by
     pretended miracles.

     2. NEW JERUSALEMITES, or SWEDENBORGIANS, so called from their
     leader, who pretended to have received a new revelation.

     3 . SOUTHCOTIANS; the followers of Johanna Southcote, who pretended
     to be a prophetess.

     4. IRVINGITES; so called from one of their chief leaders, who
     pretend to have received a new Revelation, and a new order of
     Apostles, which, like the Papists, they attempt to confirm by
     pretended gifts of unknown tongues, prophecy, and miracles; like all
     under this head, a mixture of delusion and imposture.

     Churchman, whosoever thou art, that readest the list of follies and
     errors in the 2d and 3d classes, into which the pride of man's
     heart and the wiles of Satan have beguiled so many of those who call
     upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, first give to God your
     hearty thanks for having preserved you a member of the "One Holy,
     Catholic, and Apostolic Church," which teaches the way of God in
     truth, "neither handling the word of God deceitfully," like the
     second class, nor following cunningly devised fables, like the
     third, but, by manifestation of the truth, commending itself to
     every man's conscience in the sight of God. Next pray to Him
     for yourself, that you may have grace to walk worthy of your high
     calling and privilege; in repentance, faith, and holiness, and in
     close communion with the Church, especially by a frequent
     participation in the Eucharistic Sacrifice and Sacrament of the
     Lord's Supper, which is at once the highest and most essential
     act of Christian worship, and the surest token of Church membership.
     Next pray to God for mercy upon all, both those who have gone beyond
     or fallen short of the Truth, and those who have altogether rejected
     it; that He may be pleased so to turn their hearts, and fetch them
     home to His flock, that they may be saved together with His true
     servants, and be made one fold under one Shepherd.

     One word more. From each of these three Classes, which have been
     here considered, the Church in England has undergone persecution.
     1st. In the 4th and 6th centuries, from those who reject the Truth,
     when they who denied that JESUS is the CHRIST the SON of the living
     GOD, expelled and murdered those who believed in Him, and called
     upon His Name. 2nd. In the 16th century, from those who teach more
     than the Truth, when the Papists or Romanists burned alive those who
     rejected their corrupt additions to the Catholic faith. 3rd. In the
     17th century, from those who teach less than the Truth, when the
     Protestant Dissenters expelled and barbarously treated the Clergy,
     shut up the Churches, and forbade the use of the English Liturgy.
     But on each occasion, though it pleased God for a while to try the
     faith and constancy of his servants by sufferings, He failed not
     finally to deliver his people, and to protect and strengthen His
     Church.

     At the present time, these three Classes of opponents have united
     their forces, and Unbeliever, Papist, and Protestant Dissenter,
     obeying Satan's bidding, are endeavouring to do that together,
     which they have failed to do singly, namely, to over throw and
     destroy our branch of the Catholic and Apostolic Church. And it is
     not improbable that GOD, for our correction and improvement, or for
     the glory of His name, may again put the faith and constancy of His
     servants to the proof, by permitting them to suffer afflictions for
     His name's sake. But as He is "the same yesterday and to-day
     and for ever," His power undiminished, His truth unchanged, we may
     rest assured, that if we will be true to Him, He will be true to us;
     and will protect the Church of His Son, which is "built upon the
     foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, JESUS CHRIST Himself being
     the Chief Corner-stone," and concerning which Church, that SON has
     said, that "the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it." Fear
     not, therefore, neither be faint-hearted; has not GOD commanded you?
     Be strong, and of good courage!

     OXFORD,

     The Feast of St. Barnabas.
