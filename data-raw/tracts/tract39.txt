                BISHOP WILSON'S FORM OF RECEIVING PENITENTS.

                                 [Number 39]
     __________________________________________________________________

     After Morning Prayers, the person who is censured to penance
     standing in the accustomed place and habit, the Minister shall
     exhort him as follows:

     BROTHER,

     The Church being a society of persons professing to live in the fear
     of God, and expecting the judgements of God to fall upon them, if
     His laws are broken without calling the offenders to account; it is
     reasonable that every member of this society, who has been guilty of
     any scandalous offence, should either openly confess his sins, and
     promise reformation for the time to come; or else should be cut off
     from the body of CHRIST, which is the Church.

     Now, to awaken you to a true sense of your condition, I will set
     before you the Word of GOD; that you may certainly know what will be
     the end of a wicked life; and that knowing the terror of the LORD,
     you may speedily turn unto Him and make your peace.

     Hear then what the Apostle St. Paul saith of great offenders:

     Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor
     effeminate, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers,
     nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of GOD.

     Hear also what the same Apostle saith:

     Now the works of the flesh are these, adultery, fornication,
     uncleanness, laciviousness, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
     emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders,
     drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you
     before, as I have told you in time past, that they which do such
     things shall not inherit the kingdom of GOD.

     It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living GOD, who
     can destroy both body and soul in hell; where the worm dieth not,
     and the fire is not quenched.

     These being the very words of GOD, you will do well to consider into
     what condition you have brought yourself; and indeed, the only
     comfort you have is this, that you are yet alive, and that the day
     of grace and repentance is yet afforded you. Which that you make use
     of, I must also let you know, what GOD has declared concerning such
     as repent and turn unto GOD, and bring forth fruits meet for
     repentance.

     To the LORD our GOD belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have
     rebelled against him.

     If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our
     sins.

     And our blessed SAVIOUR, to show us what great compassion GOD has
     for him that has gone astray, and returns to his duty; He represents
     Him as a man, who having found his lost sheep, takes it upon his
     shoulders, rejoicing.

     And in another parable, to make us understand the love of GOD for
     penitent sinners, he shows us how we may hope to be received, even
     as a compassionate father received his prodigal son, whenever he
     became humble and sensible of his faults; he embraced him, he
     clothed him, he rejoiced with his whole family. And such joy there
     is amongst the angels of GOD, when a sinner repenteth.

     Such great encouragement you have to return to GOD. But then, you
     must do it sincerely; you must not only appear outwardly a penitent,
     but with a true penitent heart come before GOD and His Church. Which
     if you do, you will not look upon this as a punishment inflicted
     upon you by the Church, but as a wholesome medicine administered for
     the good of your precious soul. Without which, you might have gone
     on, adding sin to sin, until there had been no more space for
     repentance.

     You will suffer yourself to be admonished; acknowledge your offence;
     and give glory to GOD, in owning His power to punish you in the next
     life, though you should escape in this.

     You will testify to others that it is, indeed, an evil thing and
     bitter to forsake the LORD. And owning this so publicly, you will be
     ashamed to return to the sins you have repented of.

     Then we shall pray to GOD that He would, for CHRIST's sake, accept
     of your repentance; that He would enable you to live for the time to
     come in obedience to the laws of JESUS CHRIST, that your souls may
     be saved at the day of judgement.

     These are the wholesome ends the Church proposes in her censures;
     following herein the Apostle's directions, in meekness instructing
     those that oppose themselves, that they may recover themselves out
     of the snares of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his
     will.

     Therefore, dear brother, consider that you are in the presence of
     GOD-the searcher of hearts. You may indeed, deceive this
     congregation with a feigned repentance, but you cannot deceive Him
     that made you; who, if you dissemble in this matter, will shut you
     out of heaven, though you continue a visible member of His Church
     here.

     But that we may take all due caution, I must in the name of the
     congregation, ask you these questions:

     Are you from your heart sorry for the sin you have committed?-
     Answer. I am.

     Will you be more careful for the time to come; and by GOD's help,
     avoid all temptations to it?---

     Answer. I will.

     Will you constantly pray to GOD to assist you to do so?- Answer. I
     will.

     Do you desire the forgiveness of all good Christians, whom you may
     have offended?-Answer. I do.

     And do you desire that others, seeing your admonition of such as,
     after a Christian manner, shall advise you, if they shall see you
     forget yourself and the promises you have now made?- Answer. I will.

     Then shall the Minister say,

     May the gracious GOD give you repentance to life eternal; receive
     you into his favour; continue you a true member of the Church of
     CHRIST; and bring you unto his everlasting kingdom, through the same
     JESUS CHRIST our LORD. Amen.

     After which he shall speak to the congregation as follows:

     Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren, that this person is moved by
     the good SPIRIT of GOD to confess his sins, and to be afflicted for
     then; let us, that we may mourn with him as becomes good Christians,
     consider that we are all subjects to sin, and to death eternal;

     That there is nothing so vile and wicked which we should not run
     into, did not the grace of GOD prevent us;

     That, therefore, we have nothing to value ourselves for above
     others, but what the good SPIRIT of GOD has given us.

     Let him, then, as the Apostle advises, that thinks he stands, take
     heed lest he fall.

     Let us remember the words of CHRIST, Watch and pray, that ye enter
     not into temptation; because our adversary the devil, as a roaring
     lion, walketh continually about, seeking whom he may devour.

     Let us learn never to be ashamed to acknowledge our sins to
     remembrance, and judge ourselves, though we are not censured by the
     Church. Let us confess our sins unto GOD, who is most willing to
     pardon us, if we turn unto Him with all our hearts, stedfastly
     purposing to lead a new life. Which GOD grant we may all do, for
     JESUS CHRIST's sake. Amen.

     Then shall be said distinctly the fifty-first Psalm, together with
     the Prayers appointed in the Commination service for Ash-Wednesday.

     OXFORD,

     The Feast of St. James.
