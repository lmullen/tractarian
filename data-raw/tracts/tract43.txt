     "O, they be blessed that may dwell

     Within Thy house always:

     For they all times Thy facts do tell,

     And ever give Thee praise.


     "Yea, happy sure likewise are they

     Whose stay and strength Thou art,

     Who to Thy house do mind the way,

     And seek it in their heart."

     PSALM lxxxiv. 5, 6.
       _______________________________________________________________

     AMONG all the boys of our Sunday-school, none have given me so much
     trouble as Absalom Plush, and two of farmer Yawn's sons. They
     are almost always behind their time; at school they are very
     inattentive, and at Church their conduct has been repeatedly so
     disgraceful, that it even attracted the attention of one of the
     Churchwardens, who gave them a severe reprimand, and threatened to
     send for a constable; since which they have conducted themselves
     rather more decently. Perhaps my readers may be inclined to ask why
     I suffer them to remain in the school, their behaviour having been
     so bad. My answer must be, that as they are but little boys, (for
     Absalom is the eldest, and he is not more than eleven, if so much,)
     I still hope they may improve; and if I were to put them out of the
     school, I fear I should lose all chance of gaining any influence
     over them. However I have made up my mind that if they behave in
     this sort of way again, they shall go.

     There is, too, another consideration which has rather disposed me to
     be sorry for these boys in the midst of my displeasure, namely, that
     if they had been well instructed, and a good example had been set
     them at home, they would, perhaps, have behaved differently at
     school and in Church. For young Plush does not want for sense,
     though he is so unruly; and as to the little Yawns, they are not
     naturally of bad dispositions, but so determinedly indolent and
     unwilling to make any exertion for their own improvement, that it is
     a great trial of one's patience to endeavour to teach them. I
     am, however, sorry to say, the examples they have before them at
     home are not such as to encourage them to turn to good account the
     instruction they may receive at Church or at the school. This I was
     fully aware of from the first, and, accordingly, as it is my usual
     custom when the children behave ill at school to take the first
     opportunity of mentioning it to their parents and friends, with the
     hope of throwing in a word which may be for their good too, I
     determined that I would do so in these instances.

     An occasion soon offered itself of speaking to farmer Yawn, whose
     house is very near to mine. But before I state what passed between
     us, I should say that I had, that same morning, talked the matter
     over with my friend Richard Nelson, in whose class Absalom was, as
     well as the elder of the two Yawns.

     "Sir," replied Richard, in answer to my question respecting the
     conduct of these boys, "as to Lawrence Yawn, I cannot say that he
     applies much to his book, or, as I think, ever means to do so.
     Indeed, I have heard that he should say he likes to be at the bottom
     of the class, because then he has a chance of leaning against the
     wall, or of resting on the corner of my chair. But Absalom Plush is
     much more untractable, and inclined to be impudent too. To give you
     an instance, Sir, what happened only last Sunday. He came in very
     late, as he frequently does, and when I spoke to him about it he
     only laughed, and said he could not come sooner, and under breath,
     as I thought, he should not, and he seemed to me occasionally to be
     humming to himself some kind of song."

     "A song!" said I, "what in the school? that is something new
     indeed."

     "However," proceeded Nelson, "according to your advice to us in such
     cases, I took no notice at the time: but in the evening, as he
     happened to come along the path by our garden, I said to him,
     ;Absa1om, I do wish you would pay a little more attention at
     school, I really fancied to-day you were singing something of a
     song.' ;Well,' said he, ;suppose I was---what
     then? ;twas only a bit of a tune that a man was singing in at
     father's, one night last week; and father said, that altering
     the words a little, it would just suit us boys of the Sunday-school.
     There is no harm (he continued) in the words, I will tell you what
     they were.' But they seemed to me, Sir, to be part of a very
     mischievous ballad, signifying that instead of Churches and Prayer
     Books, people had better sit in public houses and study newspapers;
     that Church-going is time-wasting, and so forth. So it is plain that
     the boy is encouraged at home in his bad ways; and, as you ask me
     the question, Sir, I fear it is not much better with the two Yawns;
     for I dare say you must have observed that there are six or seven
     people, who always come late into Church, rain or shine, morning or
     evening, and amongst them Master Yawn comes in as regularly as
     possible just about the end of the first Lesson."

     "Yes," I said, "I have observed it, and have long wished for an
     opportunity of inquiring into the cause of such a practice."

     After some other observations we parted, and it happened, as I
     before observed, that on the same day my neighbour Yawn came to our
     house to borrow a milking bucket, which I very readily lent him,
     though not with my servant's good will, as such articles seldom
     returned from the farmer's in exactly as good a condition as
     they went.

     Seeing him, then, go out of the yard with the bucket in his hand, I
     met him at the garden gate, and said to him at once, "I do wish, Mr.
     Yawn, you would speak to Lawrence and the little boy, for by their
     irregularity and extreme idleness, they vex me very much, and do
     harm to the other boys in the school."

     "Sir," he replied, making a low bow, "I am very sorry indeed to come
     troubling again so soon for a bucket, but our people are so
     careless---" "O never mind about the bucket," I said, "only
     please let it be thoroughly cleaned---but I want you to tell me
     what will be the best way of treating that idle fellow, Lawrence,
     and his little brother."

     "Sir," he answered, "I am very sorry indeed they should have done
     any thing to offend you, but you may depend on it they shall always
     for the future come to school in good time, and mind what is said to
     them; otherwise, their mother or I will give them the stick as sure
     as every Sunday morning comes round."

     "Mr. Yawn," I replied, "I should be very sorry to have Sunday made
     the day for such unpleasing performances in your house or in any
     other. I do not at all wish any boys to come to the school against
     their will, especially if their friends only send them to please
     me."

     "O Sir," he said, "I am sure it is not at all against our
     will---though, certainly, ;tis a longish while for the
     children to stay, from nine to half past twelve, or more; and I
     don't altogether wonder that the boys are tired. But they shall
     come for the future, and stay too, tired or not tired, for I should
     be very sorry we should do any thing to offend you, Sir."

     "You have told me so now three times, Mr. Yawn," I answered, "so of
     course I ought to believe it. But at all events, I hope I shall not
     offend you if I take this opportunity to ask you, why you and Edward
     Gape, and two or three others, make a rule of treating our Church
     Service in such a careless, and I must say scornful way."

     "Me treat the Church with scorn! ; he replied, "why, Sir, what
     can you be thinking of? Why I scarcely ever miss a Sunday.
     ;Twould be a good thing for you clergymen if every body else
     was as regular."

     "As to that," I replied, "it makes no sort of difference to us
     whether people come or stay away, except so far as that we ought to
     be thankful when they do right, and grieved when they neglect their
     duty. In this respect, Mr. Yawn, we are the really ;
     independent' ministers. But what I allude to is, your strange
     unaccountable custom of coming into Church so late. I have been here
     now nearly six years, and in all that time, though by your own
     account you have come to Church regularly once every Sunday, yet I
     doubt if ever you have been within the walls till after I had begun
     reading the Lessons."

     "Yes, Sir, I have," he said, "you are mistaken there."

     "Come now," I said, "if I have been here five years and a half, I
     have been here 286 Sundays, and I think I may venture to say, that
     during all that time you have not been in Church time enough to hear
     all the first Lesson more than twenty times."

     "Perhaps not," he said, "twenty is a good many."

     "Well," I replied, "I will venture to say not more than ten times."

     "I am not sure of that," he answered.

     "But I am sure of it," I said, " sure that you have not been in by
     the time that I mention, even five Sundays."

     "I can remember at least three times," he answered, "once when I
     mistook the clock, and once when old Thomas Pout brought his new
     bassoon, and on the Fast-day I was in at the Psalms, I am confident.
     But I don't wish to make an argument about the matter; I will
     tell you, Sir, plainly, that I have a great deal to do on a Sunday
     morning, more than you think of, and that instead of finding fault
     with me for being so late, you should thank me for coming at all.
     Think, Sir, how many don't come at all, and there am I in the
     pew as regular, pretty near, as old Job the clerk, only half an hour
     later."

     "Yes," I said, "you are very regular in your irregularity. But, Mr.
     Yawn, let me ask you this one question,---do you come to Church
     to do any good to ALMIGHTY GOD, or to me, or to yourself? Is it any
     profit to the ALMIGHTY that you serve Him, if such an imperfect
     attendance as yours can be called service; or to me is it any profit
     or advantage in the way of worldly interest? You know full well, my
     friend, that yours is the danger, yours will be the loss, if you
     persist in thus dishonouring the holy, jealous GOD."

     To this his only reply was, that he had been used to do it for a
     good way in forty years, and it was not to be expected he should
     alter now; and with this observation he walked slowly away with the
     bucket over his arm. But thinking, I suppose, that he had not been
     quite civil to me, he turned round with the intention, as I hoped,
     of making some sort of promise of amendment; but my hope was
     groundless, for he came back and said in rather a low voice, "I
     hope, Sir, nothing I have said will prevent you taking your butter
     of us as usual; and as to the boys, I promise you they shall be well
     punished every Sunday morning, and then, Sir, if they do behave ill,
     you know it will not be my fault, or my wife's."

     I made no answer, but as I walked back to the house, I was led sadly
     to reflect on the tendency of a worldly and selfish spirit to deaden
     not merely all serious sense of Religion, but even the natural
     affection of a parent for his children.

     Some few evenings afterwards, as I was returning homewards from a
     distant part of the parish, Nelson overtook me, when I told him of
     the conversation I had with my neighbour Yawn, adding that I had
     little hope his boys would ever come to any good, especially as
     their father seemed determined to keep to his bad habit merely
     because it was his habit, without giving any sort of reason or
     excuse for it.

     "O Sir," replied Nelson, "he fancies he has a very fair reason, only
     he did not like to mention it to you. He thinks, or at least
     pretends to think, (for I do not imagine he puts his mind much to
     any thing,) that the Church Service altogether is too long and
     tedious. And he and some others have of late been much encouraged in
     this their notion by a travelling man, (whether he comes from Hull
     or Preston I am not sure,) who quarters at Plush's
     occasionally, sometimes for a fortnight at a time, and is so kind as
     to offer to enlighten us in this dark corner of the world."

     "I have heard of him," I said; "it seems then he dabbles in religion
     as well as in politics."

     "Yes, Sir," replied Richard, "that he certainly does, for I had the
     whole account of him from a man who was working with me the week
     before last; you know him, Sir, I dare say, William Burnet."

     "O yes, I know him," I said, "very well; any thing like the prospect
     of a change in religion or politics William dearly loves, without
     troubling himself much to enquire whether or not it is likely to be
     a change for the better in either case. But what did the wise man
     from Hull say about the Church Service?"

     "Why," answered Nelson, "as I never was in company with the man
     myself, perhaps it will be the best way for me to tell you, Sir, if
     you like to hear it, what passed between Burnet and me an the
     subject. And indeed it is not Burnet only, but a good many others
     are of the same way of thinking, more than used to be formerly."

     "Yes," said I, "their number increases, I fear, very rapidly, and if
     so, all who love Truth and the Prayer-book, ought to be on their
     guard. But now will you please to tell me how you answered
     Burnet's arguments?"

     "Sir," he replied, "I will tell you as near as I can remember, what
     passed between us on this subject, though I do not promise to be
     able to repeat his exact words; and certainly nothing I said is
     worthy to be called an answer to arguments."

     "Make no apologies," I said, " but proceed."


     Well then, Sir, said Nelson, thus it was,---Burnet was constantly
     commending this friend of his, who was then lodging at Plush's,
     and wishing me to come along if it were but one evening, that I
     might judge for myself how beautiful he could talk and expound on
     any subject a person might choose to mention, politics, trade,
     agriculture, learning, religion, and what not.

     But I said to him, "No, Will, I have something else to do of an
     evening than to sit in a beer-shop listening to your friend Tiptop
     (for that is the man's name). But I dare say you can give me
     some account of his wise sayings; what was he upon last night?"

     "Last night, (said Will, after some little consideration,) last
     night he was lecturing about the Church Prayer-book, a subject that
     he has often spoken very well upon in my hearing, but never better
     than he did yesterday evening."

     "What was his argument?" I asked.

     "Judge by this," said Will, taking a printed paper out of his
     pocket, "it is one of Mr. Tiptop's perspectuses, as he calls
     them." (I have this paper with me, said Nelson to me, and with your
     leave, Sir, I will read some of the heads.) "The Church Service
     lengthy, tedious, and prolix---in this respect lamentably
     prejudicious to thc spread of vital religion---vast numbers of
     highly-talented individuals unable to devote their time and
     attention to these procrastinated forms---consequently compelled
     to neglect religion altogether---surprising effects, if the
     Service was abbreviated at least one-half--the churches immediately
     sure to be filled with crowds of devout worshippers---this with
     facility accomplished by merely shortening the lessons three-fifths,
     omitting all superstitious forms, such as the absolution, creeds,
     &c.---the Lord's Prayer repeated usque ad nauseam." (At this
     expression, Will said all the company expressed their approbation
     very vehemently, some even clapping their hands; but he did not like
     to ask what it meant, for fear of appearing ignorant): and so Mr.
     Tiptop finished with saying, that in his opinion, about a couple of
     pleasing hymns, a dozen verses out of the Testament, three or four
     prayers, and a sermon in quantity and quality according to the taste
     of the audience; this would be enough for him in all conscience, and
     he supposed for others too, and need not altogether take up more
     than thirty-five or forty minutes at the outside, allowing fifteen
     or twenty for the sermon.

     "But, Will," said I, "do you really and seriously imagine it would
     be well if such alterations as these were made in the Church
     Service?"

     "To be sure I do," he answered, "and so do many other people, who
     understand these things better than I or you do. Indeed Mr. Tiptop
     told us that some gentlemen had actually taken the matter up, and
     that it would be brought before the parliament very speedily, and
     such alterations would be made as should suit the spirit of the age;
     above all, that the Service must be shortened, otherwise the Church
     would be entirely deserted, and the Establishment upset."

     "GOD forbid," I said, "that the Church should be governed by the
     spirit of the times. I trust she is governed by a very different
     SPIRIT. I trust she may be willing to be (as you threaten) utterly
     deserted, rather than herself desert the station allotted to her by
     the Chief Shepherd. And as to the Establishment being in danger, it
     may be perhaps true, yet I am sure nothing more dangerous can befall
     it, than for our governors to hearken to the counsels of such
     orators as Tiptop, though encouraged by all the Plushes in England,
     each with a company of puffers and smokers about him."

     "But Dick," said he to me, "what is the use of a Church, my friend,
     if people are tired of it, and won't go to it."

     To this I answered, "You might as well ask, what is the use of our
     SAVIOUR'S precepts, if people are tired of them and won't
     obey them? You will not, I suppose, say, that the holy rules of the
     Gospel ought to be publicly set aside, merely because they are
     generally neglected."

     "No," he replied, "of course I do not mean that."

     "Well then," said I, "neither should you affirm that it is the duty
     of the Church to withdraw or alter her rules, merely because people
     are weary of complying with them."

     "That may be true," he answered, "but you must remember that the
     Church herself did not mean that the Service should be so long. What
     we have all at once, was formerly divided into two or three parts,
     as I have understood. Why should it not be again?"

     "What you say is, I believe, no more than the truth," I replied; "I
     have been lately reading a little book upon the subject, and from
     that I understood that there were first the early morning
     prayers---then, perhaps, after two or three hours, the
     Litany---and then again, after a short interval, the Communion
     Service, including a sermon of considerable length, (an hour
     possibly) and afterwards the administration of the Sacrament. But
     this last service alone would be much beyond Mr. Tiptop's limit
     of forty minutes; and in this way, ;the spirit of the age'
     would be more opposed even than it is now."

     "O," he said, "I never thought of having the Sacrament administered
     every Sunday."

     "Then," replied I, "you forgot one of the principal intentions f the
     Church in having the Services so divided. If the Bishops and clergy
     thought well, I do not deny that it would in many aspects be
     edifying, if this ancient custom in all its parts could be revived;
     but yet I will tell you plainly, that I do not think it would have
     the effect you seem to imagine, of bringing people to Church, for,
     to my knowledge, it was tried by a clergyman in a parish near
     Sheffield, and to his great surprise, many of his parishioners
     stayed in consequence quite away from the Church. Some said, they
     should not think of going so hear half a service; others, who had a
     mile or two to come to Church, said they were scarcely allowed to
     rest themselves, but that as soon as they got in it was time to go
     back. So the clergyman thought it best to return to the old, or,
     rather I should say, the modern custom again, of uniting the
     services."

     "And yet," said Burnet, "the American Church has shortened the
     Lessons very much, Mr. Tiptop told us."

     "It may be so," I answered, "but it does not follow that it is a
     wise measure nevertheless, though far it be from me to say that it
     is otherwise. Still, of the two, the daughter should take pattern
     from the mother, rather than the mother from the daughter. And for
     myself I must say, that I have often been glad that the Lessons are
     of considerable length, for two reasons especially.

     "What are they?" he asked.

     "The one is," I replied, "that in very short readings it is not so
     easy to discover the general meaning and argument; and the other,
     that if I have from any cause been inattentive in one part, I have
     not been so throughout. So also with respect to the Lord's
     Prayer, I have often and often been glad to have had a second and a
     third opportunity of joining in it with increased attention.
     Therefore, Will, I for one shall never give my vote to have the
     Services shortened in either of these ways; and as to Mr.
     Tiptop's fine perspectus, or what he calls it, I don't
     think it worth a rush."

     To this Burnet answered, "that it was plainly of no use to reason
     with me, as he saw I was determined to keep to the old ways."

     "That I am," said I, "and think I have pretty good authority for it,
     authority somewhat more to be depended on than Mr. Tiptop's
     opinion."

     "But," continued Will, "I do still persist in affirming that great
     numbers of people are weary of the length of the Service, and that
     it would be but common kindness to see what can be done to relieve
     their grievance. And since nothing can be more easy than just to
     omit a few prayers and other old-fashioned forms, and shorten the
     Lessons, it would be a shame not to try it, and when it is done,
     every body will be pleased, and the Church establishment will be
     greatly strengthened."

     "Well," said I, "whatever effect such a measure might have on the
     Establishment, I am confident it would deeply injure the Church. And
     as to what you say about relieving a grievance, I wish you to
     consider this argument which I met with in a book of Sermons that
     was lent to me a few weeks ago. ;If people were weary merely of
     the length of the Service, they would be at least attentive at the
     beginning, and their weariness would come on by degrees; but we know
     it is not so. Of the two, they are often more tired in the early
     part of the Service than in the later.' I do not remember the
     exact words, but such is the meaning."

     "Yes," he said, "that is because they care more about the sermon
     than they do about the Prayers and Lessons."

     "Very well," I replied, "you have supplied me with a strong argument
     against your own views. For by whose opinion do you think the Church
     ought to be chiefly guided, that if the few (if they be few) who
     delight in the Prayers and Lessons, or that of the many (if they be
     many) who are weary of them even from the beginning?"

     "Why," he replied, "I thought it was now almost universally agreed,
     that What most people think, is True---What most people
     determine, is Just---What most people like, is Good. Mr. Tiptop
     called these ;Three Grand Parliamentary Principles,' and
     we all admired them."

     "But, Will," I said, "suppose it should happen that, ;What most
     people like' might be to get rid of the restraints of Religion
     altogether, I reckon you would not consider this a safe and good
     principle to be guided by; and yet you may be sure that this, and
     nothing less than this, lies at the root of all these pretended
     Church Reforms. And as to the principal contriver of these deceits,
     the Great Reformer himself, I do not choose to mention his name to
     you, but I think you will find him spoken of, and hid character
     awfully set forth, in the eighth chapter of St. John, and if I
     recollect right, the 44th verse.

     "But really now, Will," I continued, "will you be kind enough to
     tell me, what are people hindered from by the length of the Service?
     how comes it men's time is so much more precious now than it
     was formerly? and if the Service were made shorter how would they be
     better employed than in hearing GOD'S holy word, and praying
     for His blessing on themselves and their friends?

     "I say, Will, what do Farmer Yawn, and Ned Gape, and the rest of you
     do, who walk always so late into Church; are you spending your time
     any better than if you came into GOD'S house before the bell
     ceases?"

     "As to that," said he, laughing, "we generally sit on the wall, at
     least when the weather is dry, and look at Ned's pigs, or talk
     over the news, or anything, just to pass the time. But the
     farmer's rule is, to begin shaving just as the bells chime, and
     then he comes in at the first Lesson as exact as clock-work, and we
     after him."

     "Then;" said I, "why should you and he trouble about having the
     Service shortened, for I suppose, whatever were its length or
     shortness, you would always come in twenty minutes after it had
     begun."

     "That would be as we should please," he said. "However, I see
     plainly I shall never be able to reason you out of your bigoted
     old-fashioned notions. I only wish I could bring you and Mr. Tiptop
     together. I think he would soon settle you and your arguments too;
     he would quickly turn the laugh against you, I can assure you,
     Master Nelson."

     To this I answered, "that I had no reason to be afraid of Tiptop,
     his arguments, or his jests, but that 1 never would willingly go or
     stay in the company of persons who could make light of serious
     matters; and I told Burnet, that I was sure sooner or later, he
     would allow that I was right in this resolution."

     "This, Sir, was the substance of my conversation with Will; and if
     you should be disengaged next Sunday evening and disposed to see me,
     I should be glad to have a few more words with you on the same
     subject."

     To this I readily agreed, so we parted at his garden-gate; and as I
     heard his door shut, I could not but say to myself, if happiness is
     to be found on earth it is in that cottage, and what is the precious
     secret whereby it has been attained? No secret at all, (I answered
     myself) but simply the practice of "pure and undefiled religion,"
     "patient continuance in well doing," with "glory, honour, and
     immortality" in view.

     When he came to me in my study on the Sunday evening, according to
     appointment, he said that he really was anxious to know whether
     there was any truth in the report which Tiptop and others had so
     confidently spread about, that some alteration of the Prayer-book
     was intended, especially (as they said) for the purpose of making
     the Service more ;short and compact, and suitable to the taste
     of the times.'

     I answered, "that of course it was out of my power to say what our
     governors in Church or State might wish, but that I feared that in
     Religion, as in other matters, there was some reason to apprehend
     too great regard might be paid to popular fancies, even by those who
     are as far as possible from approving of them."

     "Sir," he replied very earnestly, "I hope and trust the Church
     Services will never be shortened one sentence, line, or word. Grown
     people, Sir, are but children in Religion. If once you begin to
     yield to their indolence and dislike of trouble, you sanction the
     bad feeling, and it will go on increasing till it has eaten out the
     very heart of piety."

     "Yes," I replied, "I fully agree with you. And to say the truth, it
     is my firm opinion that if any alteration is necessary, it is the
     other way, that the Service should be longer instead of shorter. I
     mean, for instance, that the "Prayer for Christ's Church
     Militant" should be regularly used as appointed, after the morning
     sermon when there is no Communion; at least where it can be done
     without any great inconvenience, which possibly in some churches may
     not be the case. It is to my mind one of the most perfect of
     uninspired compositions, and it is greatly to be wished that it
     might be made familiar to every ear and every heart."

     "Sir," said he, "I have often thought so. Still at the best our
     weakness is great: ;the corruptible body,' as the wise man
     says, ;presses down the soul;' and I suppose it is the
     case with all of us occasionally, and even when we would most
     earnestly deplore and strive against it, that our thoughts are apt
     to wander and our devotions to be cold. Whenever, therefore, I have
     found myself disposed to be weary of GOD'S house and service,
     or have beard others complaining of the tediousness of the Prayers
     and Lessons, I have said to myself,---if David, the Prince of
     Penitents, were here now, would he speak or think thus, he who
     desired to abide in GOD'S tabernacle for ever---who envied
     (as it were) the sparrows and the swallows their continual abode
     under the sacred roof---who, when shut out, or far away longed,
     yea, even fainted for the courts of the LORD, as a hart thirsting
     for the water brooks! If holy Daniel, that greatest of statesmen,
     that real "man of business;" if he were among us now---he, who in
     a far distant land, and prime minister to the greatest of earthly
     kings, would yet let no day pass in which he would not thrice find
     or make leisure to offer solemn prayers to the GOD of his fathers,
     his windows being open in his chamber towards Jerusalem, where lay
     the temple of his GOD in ruins; that as he could not be there in
     person, he would be so in heart and mind, would he say that our
     Church Service is too long? If St. Paul, that most heroic, and (if
     there were such a word,) that most unselfish of men,---if he were
     now among us, would he be weary of our Lessons, Prayers, and
     Creeds,---he whose conversation and home was in heaven---who
     desired to depart and to be with CHRIST, and who calls on all true
     Christians to "hold fast the form of sound words," in Christian
     faith and love! Or the beloved John, the last and greatest of
     prophets,---weary, not of his LORD'S service, but of being
     kept so long from his presence would he, and all the other holy men
     of every age, prophets, apostles, martyrs, confessors, and saints,
     whether of the Patriarchal, Jewish, or Christian Churches, would
     they complain of our Services being TOO LONG?

     "O no, Sir, that is not to be imagined. So neither ought we to
     complain, heirs with them of the same promises, and looking to meet
     them hereafter in our one great eternal Home."

     "Richard," I replied, "you say true. As it is dangerous for an
     individual to take for his guidance any but a perfect pattern of
     Christian conduct, so is it dangerous for the Church to follow any
     but a perfect model of Christian worship, so far as perfection can
     be obtained. Her rules should be framed not according to what people
     are, but what they ought to be: otherwise you must plainly see that
     a door will be at once opened for numberless errors as well in
     doctrine as in practice."

     "Yes, Sir, I see it," he replied. "And, therefore, it seems to me,
     that when on such subjects popular opinion runs vehemently in a
     wrong direction, (or if not wrong, at least questionable,) that then
     it is not the best time, but the very worst possible, for yielding
     to its fancies. So that even if it should be at any time, necessary
     or expedient (which I cannot think it ever will be) to shorten the
     Church Services, yet then is the very worst of all times to set
     about it, when there is the greatest demand for it."

     "You are quite right," I said, "beyond all doubt. But I think it
     would be a great support to the good cause, that is, to the cause of
     GOD, and truth, the Church, and the Prayer Book; and also a great
     encouragement to such among us of the clergy as desire to stand in
     the old paths; if in every parish a few serious thinking persons
     would consider of drawing up and signing a solemn address to their
     respective Bishops, plainly saying that they utterly disapprove of
     all plans whatever for shortening the Church Service, unless some
     urgent cause should arise, stronger than they have ever yet heard;
     and that as churchmen they never can or will consent to any such
     plans of miscalled Church reform. For you know, Richard, laymen are
     quite as much part of THE CHURCH as the clergy; and it is your right
     and duty to stand up in its defence, as much as it is ours."

     "Sir," he replied, "you may he sure I would gladly sign such a
     declaration as this you propose, and I think I know four or five
     more who would sign it also with all their hearts."

     "That will be sufficient," I said, "for our parish, for no doubt the
     Bishops will estimate the value of such addresses, not by the
     quantity, but by the quality of those who sign them---not by the
     number of names, but by the worth of those who bear them, their
     honesty, piety, and truth."

     So we agreed that an address of this kind should be prepared, and
     kept ready to be presented to the Bishop whenever circumstances
     should seem to require.

     Not of course that we were so vain as to expect that our exertions
     could be of much avail; but still, as Richard said, "We cannot stand
     by and see the noble old Prayer Book pulled to pieces, just to
     humour a mob of Tiptops, Gapes, and Yawns."
