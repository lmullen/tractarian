     Question from the Office of Consecration
     .------ARE YOU PERSUADED THAT THE HOLY SCRIPTURES CONTAIN
     SUEFICIENTLY ALL DOCTRINE REQUIRED OF NECESSITY TO ETERNAL SALVATION
     THROUGH FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST? AND ARE YOU DETERMINED, OUT OF THE
     SAME HOLY SCRIPTURES, TO INSTRUCT THE PEOPLE COMMITTED TO YOUR
     CHARGE, AND TO TEACH OR MAINTAIN NOTHING AS REQUIRED OF NECESSITY TO
     ETERNAL SALVATION, BUT THAT WHICH YOU SHALL BE PERSUADED MAY BE
     CONCLUDED AND PROVED BY THE SAME ?---Ans. I AM so PERSUADED AND
     DETERMINED BY GOD'S GRACE.

     Question
     .---WILL YOU THEN FAITHFULLY EXCERCISE YOURSELF IN THE SAME HOLY
     SCRIPTURES, AND CALL UPON GOD BY PRAYER FOR THE TRUE UNDERSTANDING1,
     OF THE SAME; SO AS YOU MAY BE ABLE BY THEM TO TEACH AND EXHORT WITH
     WHOLESOME DOCTRINE, AND TO WITHSTAND AND CONVINCE GAINSAYERS ?---
     Ans. I WILL DO SO BY THE HELP OF GOD.

     O GOD, the fountain of all wisdom, enlighten my mind, that I myself
     may seek and be able to teach others, the wonders of Thy law; that I
     may learn from Thee, what I ought to think and speak concerning
     Thee; and that whatever in Thy Holy Word I shall profitably learn, I
     may in deed fulfil the same. Direct and bless all my labours. Give
     me a discerning spirit, a sound judgment, and an honest and a
     religious heart, that in all my studies my first aim may be to set
     forth Thy glory, by setting forward the salvation of men. And if, by
     my ministry, Thy kingdom shall be enlarged, let me, in all humility,
     ascribe the success, not unto myself, but unto Thy Good Spirit,
     which enables us both to will and to do what is acceptable to Thee,
     through JESUS CHRIST our Lord. Amen.

     Acts vi. 4. "But we will give ourselves continually unto prayer, and
     to the ministry of the word."

     Luke vi. 39. "Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall
     into the ditch?"

     1 Tim. iv. 13. "Give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
     doctrine." Quesnelle says, Not to read, is to tempt GOD; to do
     nothing but study, is to forget the ministry. To read, in order to
     appear more learned, is a sinful vanity. But to read, in order to
     exhort, and to instruct with wholesome doctrine, this is according
     to GOD'S will and word.

     James i. 5. "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of GOD, who
     giveth to every man liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be
     given him." Wisdom being the gift of GOD, and this gift the fruit of
     prayer, a prayer that is humble, earnest, and per severing, will
     assuredly be blessed with this excellent gift. O JESUS, cause me to
     read, to understand, to love, to practise, and to preach Thy Word.

     John vii. 17. "If any man will do (that is, is disposed, de sires to
     do) His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of GOD,
     or whether I speak of myself." Light and truth discover themselves
     to such as desire to follow them.

     Ps. xxv. 14. "The secret of the LORD is among them that fear Him,
     and He will shew them His covenant." It was the saying of a learned
     man, saith Dr. Lightfoot, that he got more knowledge by his prayers
     than by all his studies.

     Matth. xi. 25. "I thank Thee, O FATHER, LORD of heaven and earth,
     because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and
     hast revealed them unto babes." My GOD and SAVIOUR, imprint on my
     heart the amiable characters of simplicity and humility, which are
     the marks of Thy elect, of such to whom Thou wilt reveal Thyself. It
     is a dangerous mistake to think that any man can have a right
     understanding of divine things, without being illuminated by divine
     grace, and without leading an holy life.

     Ps. cxix. 19. "I have more understanding than my teachers, because I
     keep Thy commandments." There is a light arising from a sincere good
     life, which dispelleth all darkness, and is the best defence against
     error and sophistry.

     Ps. xxv. 10. "All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto
     such as keep His covenant and His Testimonies." That is; to such as
     do so, all the ways of GOD, and whatever He hath revealed, will
     appear to be the effect of infinite wisdom, goodness, justice, and
     truth. He giveth light and understanding unto the simple.

     Matt. v. 8. "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see GOD."

     Luke xxii. 32. "When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren."
     GOD grant that we may all of us consider the absurdity of going
     about to convert others, without being converted ourselves. To
     understand the Holy Scriptures aright, is to understand them as the
     Primitive Church did.

     1 Sam. iii. 9. "Speak, LORD, for Thy servant heareth." Speak to my
     heart, that I may obey Thy word. "Teach me to do Thy will, for thou
     art my GOD." It belongs to GOD, to give the true understanding of
     His own word.

     Matt. vii. 5. "Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine
     own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of
     thy brother's eye." That is, purify your own heart from all
     worldly aims; mortify your own passions, which are the cause of your
     blindness; study that Word which alone can en lighten you; and lay
     aside all prejudices which are contrary to piety. A Pastor should
     never undertake to teach a virtue which he has never practised
     himself.

     Luke v. 5. "We have toiled all the night, and taken nothing." So
     does every preacher, who does not beg GOD'S blessing upon his
     labours. It is impossible for any man to teach well, who does not
     live well.

     "My people perish for want of knowledge." The design of Religion
     being to lead men to GOD, how he is to be served, appeased,
     attained; the business of a preacher should be to show how all the
     parts of religion contribute to these ends. He that reads the Sacred
     Scriptures, and understands the things concerning the kingdom of
     GOD, and the way of conducting men thither, need not complain for
     want of learning. In preaching, we must speak to the heart, as well
     as to the understanding and to the ear. The end of preaching is, to
     turn men from sin unto GOD, that they may be saved. He that has not
     this in his view will do little good. A preacher should accustom
     himself to give a practical turn to every thing. He that leaves it
     to his hearers to apply what he has said, leaves to them the
     greatest part of his own duty. To be heartily in love with the truth
     one recommends, is the great secret of becoming a good preacher.

     John vii. 16. "My doctrine is not Mine, but His that sent Me." To
     preach our own thoughts, forsaking GOD'S word, is like an
     ambassador, who neglects his prince's instructions, and follows
     his own fancy. With what truth can it be said, that "the sheep hear
     his voice," when the shepherd speaks of things, or in such a manner,
     as is above their capacity? Grant, O LORD, that I may read thy word
     with the same spirit with which it was written. Learning does not
     always lead men to GOD; it often carries them from him. Indeed, when
     they study to find out, and correct their own weakness, their folly,
     and the corruption of their nature; to be convinced of the evil of
     sin, of the vanity of the world; to fill their souls with heavenly
     wisdom and devout affections towards GOD; and all this, that they
     may be better able to convince and edify their neighbour; such
     learning leads men indeed to GOD:---the rest is folly. Have mercy
     upon all that sit in darkness; and may the saving truths of the
     Gospel be received in all the world! He that sets his heart upon the
     world, is not in a capacity of understanding the Gospel. Give me
     that true wisdom which consists in knowing how to save myself and
     them that hear me. Remember, that a man may have the knowledge of
     the Word, without the Spirit.

                         Obscurity of the Scriptures

     Serves to subdue the pride of man; to convince us, that to
     understand them, we have need of a light superior to reason, and
     that we may apply to GOD for help. May I ever understand the true
     language of thy Word, O LORD, and profit by it! Vouchsafe, O GOD, to
     give me a love for thy Sacred Scriptures, and a true understanding
     of them, that I may see therein the wonders of thy conduct, and thy
     love for us, thy miserable creatures.

                                   Sermons

     Should be instructions, not declamations, or displaying curious
     thoughts, which may amuse, but not edify Christians. If GOD suffers
     even an holy pastor not presently to see the fruits of his labours,
     it is to convince him, that the success of his labours belongs to
     GOD; that he ought to humble himself, and pray much, and fear lest
     the fault should be in himself.

     Pride and irreligion meet with darkness in the midst of light; raise
     vain disputes, unprofitable reflections and inquiries; while
     humility attains to light, in the midst of darkness and
     difficulties.

     Whenever GOD vouchsafes to open the heart, be the under standing and
     parts never so small, we see the reasonableness and beauty of His
     Word, we taste the sweetness, and feel the power thereof.

     John xii. 16. "These things understood not His disciples at the
     first; but when JESUS was glorified, then remembered they that these
     things were written of Him, and that they had done these things unto
     Him." We often read the Scripture, without comprehending its full
     meaning; however, let us not be discouraged; the light, in
     GOD'S good time, will break out, and disperse the darkness, and
     we shall see the mysteries of the Gospel. Grant me, O LORD, a
     persevering love of Thy Word, and so much light, as is necessary for
     myself, and those that hear me.

     John xii. 30. "JESUS said, This voice came not for Me, but for your
     sakes." The way to profit by reading the Scriptures, is to apply to
     ourselves that which is spoken in general to all; this truth, this
     command, this threat, this promise, this intimation, is to me.

     John xii. 49. "I have not spoken of myself, but the FATHER which
     sent me gave me a command, what I should say, and how I should
     speak." He preaches with a well-grounded confidence, who advances
     nothing merely of his own head, but what he has received from GOD.
     He may then expect a blessing. But then, let him take care not to
     disguise it by a language foreign from GOD'S Word. O HOLY
     SPIRIT of grace, cause me both to understand and love thy Word.

     Acts i. 1. "The former treatise have I made of all that JESUS began
     both to do and teach." This is the whole of a Pastor's life.
     For a man to preach the Gospel before he has practised it, is to be
     a very bad imitator of the Prince of Pastors. LORD, grant that I may
     imitate thee by a life conformable to thine; by all ways becoming my
     station in the Church; and lay hold of all the opportunities which
     Thou shalt put into my hands. It is GOD who does all good by the
     labours of His ministers. To Him, therefore, must be all the praise.
     More sinners are converted by holy, than by learned men. Inflame my
     heart, O GOD, with an ardent love for Thy Word, an ardent zeal for
     Thy Glory, with a pure and disinterested love for Thy Church, and
     with an hearty desire of establishing Thy kingdom. Who can say it is
     not owing to himself, that his flock are ignorant of their duty?

     Rom. ii. 21. "Thou, therefore, which teachest another, teachest thou
     not thyself?" Unhappy that person who has in his hands the rule of
     knowledge and of the truth, and makes no other use thereof, but to
     set up for a teacher of others, without applying to himself those
     truths with which his mind is filled. A mind full of light, and a
     heart full of darkness, how dreadful is that man's condition!
     "Without holiness no man shall see the LORD." In all our studies, we
     should take care to beg of GOD to preserve us from error, and to
     lead us to, and keep us in, all truths necessary to salvation, by
     His HOLY SPIRIT.

     Col. iv. 4. "That I may make it manifest, (that is, the mystery of
     the Gospel) as I ought to speak." All preachers do not speak as they
     ought. A man may have the skill to give Christian truths a turn
     agreeable to the hearers, without affecting their hearts. Human
     learning will enable him to do this. It is prayer only that can
     enable him so to speak as to convert the heart. May I ever speak to
     the hearts, and to the capacities of my flock.

     2. Tim. iv. 1, 2, 3, &c. "I charge thee, before GOD and the LORD
     JESUS CHRIST, preach the Word. Be instant in season, out of season;
     reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and gravity. For the
     time will come, when they will not endure sound doctrine; and they
     shall turn away their ears from the truth. But watch thou in all
     things, endure afflictions, make full proof of (or fulfil) thy
     ministry." Preaching is a duty, but not the only duty of a Pastor.
     He is to take all occasions to instruct those that seek the truth;
     refute such as oppose it; reprove those that do not practise it; and
     confirm such as have embraced it. And the more we perceive the times
     of Apostasy approaching, the more zealous ought we to be to defend
     sound doctrine. We deceive ourselves, if we fancy that we have done
     our duty when we have given our people a sermon one day in seven: we
     must try all ways to gain a soul. It will be no comfort to a Pastor,
     that the world praises him for some one part of his duty, while GOD
     condemns him for the neglect of another.

     l Pet. iv. 11 "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of
     GOD." That is, worthy of GOD, not weakening it by softening
     interpretations, nor altering it by human inventions, nor degrading
     it by a profane eloquence. If we find that people do not attend to
     the Sacred Scripture, as the Word of GOD, with eagerness and
     attention, we ought to fear that the fault is in those that preach
     it after such a manner as is not proper or likely to make them
     believe it to be the Word of GOD. It is good to know what GOD has
     revealed, and to be ignorant of what he has not thought fit to make
     known to us.

               Ejaculations before reading the Holy Scriptures.

     Give me, O GOD, a love for thy Scriptures, and a true under standing
     of them. O JESUS, open my understanding, cause me to love Thy Word,
     and to order my faith and life according to it. May I, O JESUS, love
     Thy Word, make Thy Gospel my delight, and continue in the practice
     of Thy law unto my life's end.

                              Reading Scripture.

     John xvi. 13. "The HOLY SPIRIT shall guide you into all truth." O
     HOLY SPIRIT, make me to understand, embrace, and love the truths of
     the Gospel. Give, O GOD, Thy blessing unto Thy Word, that it may
     become effectual to my conversion and salvation, and to the
     salvation of all that read or hear it. Give me grace to read Thy
     Holy Word with reverence and respect becoming the gracious
     manifestation of Thy Will to men; submitting my understanding and
     will to Thine. Let Thy gracious promises, O GOD, contained in Thy
     Word, quicken my obedience. Let Thy dreadful threatenings and
     judgments upon sinners, fright me from sin, and oblige me to a
     speedy repentance, for JESUS CHRIST His sake. Cause me, O GOD, to
     believe Thy Word, to obey Thy commands, to fear Thy judgments, and
     to hope in, and depend upon, Thy gracious promises contained ill Thy
     Holy Word, for JESUS CHRIST'S sake. Grant, O LORD, that in
     reading Thy Holy Word, 1 may never prefer my private sentiments
     before those of the Church in the purely ancient times of
     Christianity. Give me a full persuasion of those great truths, which
     Thou hast revealed in Thy Holy Word. The Gospel will not be a means
     of salvation to him who reads or hears it only, but to him who
     reads, loves, remembers, and practises it by a lively faith. Cause
     me, O GOD, rightly to understand, and constantly to walk in the way
     of Thy commandments. Grant us in this world knowledge of Thy truth,
     and in the world to come life everlasting, for JESUS CHRIST'S
     sake. Amen. From hardness of heart and contempt of Thy Word, Good
     LORD deliver us. Give us all grace to hear meekly Thy Word, to
     receive it with pure affection, and to bring forth the fruits of the
     SPIRIT, to amend our lives according to Thy Holy Word.

     Luke xxiv. 45. "Then opened he their understanding, that they might
     understand the Scriptures." Unless Thou, O JESUS, openest our
     understanding, all our pains, all our learning, will signify little.

     Matt. xiii. 36. "Declare unto us this parable." This should instruct
     us, that the knowledge of GOD'S Word, and the mysteries of the
     Gospel, are favours which we must always beg of GOD.
