                          THE GROUNDS OF OUR FAITH.

     __________________________________________________________________

     EVERY system of theology has its dangers, its tendencies towards
     evil. Systems short of the truth have this tendency inherent in
     themselves, and in process of time discover it, and work out the
     anticipated evil, which is but the legitimate though latent
     consequence of their principles. Thus, we may consider the present
     state of Geneva the fair result on the long run of the system of
     self-will which was established there in the sixteenth century. But
     even the one true system of religion has its dangers on all sides,
     from the weakness of its recipients who pervert it. Thus the Holy
     Catholic doctrines, in which the Church was set up, were corrupted
     into Popery, not legitimately, or necessarily, but by various
     external causes acting on human corruption, in the lapse of many
     ages. St. Paul's command of obedience to rulers, was changed
     into the tyrannical rule of one Bishop over all countries; his
     recommendation of an unmarried life, for certain religious objects,
     was made a rule of celibacy in the case of the clergy. Now let us
     ask, what are the bad tendencies of Protestantism? for this is a
     question which nearly concerns ourselves. We are nearly 300 years
     from its rise in this country; have any evils yet shown themselves
     from it? It is not here proposed to examine the question at large;
     but a hint on one part of the subject, may be made in answer to it.

     At the Reformation, the authority of the Church was discarded a by
     the spirit then predominant among Protestants, and Scripture was
     considered as the sole document both for ascertaining and proving
     our faith. The question immediately arose, "Is this or that doctrine
     in Scripture ?"---and in consequence, various intellectual gifts,
     such as argumentative subtilty, critical acumen, knowledge of the
     languages, rose into importance, and became the interpreters of
     Christian truth. Exposition lay through controversy. Now the natural
     effect of disputation is to make us shun all but the strongest
     proofs, those which an adversary will find substantial impediments
     in his line of reasoning; and, therefore, to generate a cautious
     discriminative turn of thought, to fix in the mind a standard of
     proof simulating demonstration, and to make light of mere
     probabilities. This intellectual habit, resulting from controversy,
     would also arise from the peculiar exercises of thought necessary
     for the accurate scholar or antiquarian. It followed, that in course
     of time, all the delicate shades of truth and falsehood, the
     unobtrusive indications of GOD'S Will, the low tones of the " still
     small voice," in which Scripture abounds, were rudely rejected; the
     crumbs from the rich man's table, which Faith eagerly looks
     about for, were despised by the proud-hearted intellectualist, who
     (as if it were a favour in him to accept thc Gospel,) would be
     content with nothing short of certainty, and ridiculed as
     superstitious and illogical whatever did not approve itself to his
     own cold, hard, and unimpassioned temper. For instance, if the cases
     of Lydia, of the jailer, of Stephanas, were brought to show our
     LORD'S wish as to the baptism of households, the actions of his
     apostles to interpret his own commands, it was answered; " This is
     no satisfactory proof; it is not certain that everyone of those
     households was not himself a believer; it is not certain there were
     any children among them;"---though surely, in as many all three
     households, the probability is on the side which the Church has
     taken, especially viewing the texts in connexion with our SAVIOUR'S
     words, "Suffer the little children," &c. Again, while the observance
     of the LORD'S day was grounded upon the practice of the apostles, it
     was somehow felt, that this proof was not strong enough to bind the
     mass of Protestants: and so the chief argument now in use is one
     drawn from the Jewish law, viz. the direct Scripture command,
     contained in the fourth commandment.

     Our SAVIOUR has noticed the frame of mind here alluded to, in Mark
     viii. 11, 12, where his feelings and judgment upon it are also told
     us:---"And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with
     Him, seeking of Him a sign from heaven, tempting Him. And He sighed
     deeply in His spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after
     a sign? Verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto
     this generation. And He left them."

     We are warned against the same hard, intractable temper in the book
     of Psalms:---"I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way
     wherein thou shalt go; and I will guide thee with Mine eye. Be ye
     not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding; whose
     mouths must be held with bit and bridle, lest they fall upon thee."
     Ps. xxxii. 9, 10. This stubborn spirit, which yields to nothing but
     violence, is determined to feel CHRIST'S yoke ere it submits to
     it, will not see except in broad day-light, and like the servant who
     hid his talent, is ever making excuses, murmuring, doubting,
     grudging obedience, and stifling docile and open hearted faith, is
     the spirit of ultra-Protestantism, i.e. that spirit, to which the
     principles of Protestantism tend, and which they have in a great
     measure realized. On this subject the reader may consult Nos. 4, 8,
     and 19, of this series of Tracts.

     Now to apply this to the doctrines, at present so much undervalued,
     which it is the especial object of these Tracts to enforce.

     When a clergyman has spoken strongly in defence of Episcopacy, a
     hearer will go away saying, that there is much very able and
     forcible, much very eloquent and excellent, in what he has just
     heard; but after all, there is very little about Episcopacy in
     Scripture. This is the point to which a shrewd, clear-headed
     reasoner will resort,---"after all;" we come round and round to
     it; the doctrine advocated is plausible, useful, generally received
     hitherto;---granted,---but Scripture says very little about
     it.

     Now it cannot be for a moment allowed, that Scripture contains
     little on the subject of Church Government; though it may readily be
     granted that it obtrudes on the reader little about it. The doctrine
     is in it, not on it; not on the surface. This need not be proved
     here, since the subject has been variously considered in former
     Numbers of this series. But it may be useful in a few words to show
     how the state of the argument and controversy concerning Episcopacy,
     illustrates the above remarks, and how parallel it is to the state
     in which other religious truths are found, which no Churchman
     ventures to dispute.

     1. Now in the first place, let us suppose, for the sake of argument,
     that Episcopacy is in fact not at all mentioned in Scripture: even
     then it would be our duty to receive it. Why? because the first
     Christians received it. If we wish to get at the truth, no mater how
     we get at it, if we get at it. If it be a fact, that the earliest
     Christian communities were universally episcopal, it is a reason for
     our maintaining Episcopacy; and in proportion to our conviction, is
     it incumbent on us to maintain it.

     Nor can it be fairly dismissed as a non-essential, or ordinance
     indifferent and mutable, though formerly existing over Christendom;
     for, who made us judges of essentials and non-essentials? how do we
     determine them? In the Jewish law, the slightest transgression of
     the commandment was followed by the penalty of death; vide Lev.
     viii. 35; x. 6. Does not its universality imply a necessary
     connexion with Christian doctrine? Consider how much reasonings
     would carry us through life; how the business of the world depends
     on punctuality in minutes; how "great a matter" a mere spark dropped
     on gunpowder "kindleth."

     But, it may be urged, that we Protestants believe the Scriptures to
     contain the whole rule of duty.---Certainly not; they constitute
     a rule of faith, not a rule of practice; a rule of faith, not a rule
     of practice; a rule of doctrine, not a rule of conduct or
     discipline. Where (e.g.) are we told in Scripture, that gambling is
     wrong? or again, suicide? our Article is precise: "Holy Scripture
     containeth all things necessary to salvation, so that whatsoever is
     not read therein, &c. is not to be required of any man, that it
     should be believed as an article of faith." Again it says, that the
     Apocrypha is not to be applied "to establish any doctrine," implying
     that this is the use of the canonical books.

     2. However, let us pass from this argument, which is but founded on
     a supposition, that Episcopacy is not enjoined in Scripture. Suppose
     we maintain, as we may well maintain, that it is enjoined in
     Scripture. An objector will say, that, at all events it is but
     obscurely contained therein, and cannot be drawn out from it without
     a great deal of delicate care and skill. Here comes in the operation
     of that principle of faith in opposition to criticism, which was
     above explained; the principle of being content with a little light,
     where we cannot obtain sunshine. If it is probably pleasing to
     CHRIST, let us maintain it. Now take a parallel case: e.g. the
     practice of infant baptism; where is this enjoined in Scripture? No
     where. Why do we observe it? Because the primitive Church observed
     it, and because the Apostles in Scripture appear to have sanctioned
     it, though this is not altogether certain from Scripture. In a
     difficult case we do all well as we can, and carefully study what is
     most agreeable to our LORD and SAVIOUR. This is how our Church
     expresses it in the xxviith Article: "The baptism of young children
     is in any wise to be retained in the Church, as most agreeable with
     the institution of CHRIST." This is true wariness and Christian
     caution; very different from that spurious caution which
     ultra-Protestantism exercises. Let a man only be consistent, and
     apply the same judgment in the case of Episcopacy: let him consider
     whether the duty of keeping to Bishops, be not "most agreeable with
     the institution of CHRIST." If, indeed, he denies this altogether,
     these remarks do not apply; but they are addressed to waverers, and
     falsely moderate men, who cannot deny, that the evidence of
     Scripture is in favour of Churchmen, but say it is not strong
     enough. They say, that if Almighty GOD had intended an uniformity in
     Church Government among Christians, he would have spoken more
     clearly.

     Now if they carried on this line of argument consistently, they
     would not baptize their children: happily they are inconsistent. It
     would be more happy still, were they consistent on the other side;
     and, as they baptize their children, because it is safer to observe
     than to omit the sacrament, did they also keep to the Church, as the
     safer side. The received practice, then, of infant baptism seems a
     final answer to all who quarrel with the Scripture evidence for
     Episcopacy.

     3. But further still, infant baptism, like Episcopacy, is but a case
     of discipline. What shall we say, when we consider that a case of
     doctrine, necessary doctrine, doctrine the very highest and most
     sacred, may be produced, where the argument lies as little on the
     surface of Scripture,---where the proof, though most conclusive,
     is as indirect and circuitous as that for Episcopacy; viz. the
     doctrine of the Trinity? Where is this solemn and comfortable
     mystery formally stated in Scripture, as we find it in the creeds?
     Why is it not? Let a man consider whether all the objections which
     he urges against the Scripture argument for Episcopacy may not be
     turned against his own belief in the Trinity. It is a happy thing
     for themselves that men are inconsistent; yet it is miserable to
     advocate and establish a principle, which, not in their own case
     indeed, but in the case of others who learn it of them, leads to
     Socinianism. This being considered, can we any longer wonder at the
     awful fact, that the descendants of Calvin, the first Presbyterian,
     are at the present day in the number of those who have denied the
     LORD who bought them?
