     Question from the Office of Ordination
     .--- ARE YOU READY, WITH ALL FAITHFUL DILIGENCE, TO BANISH AND
     DRIVE AWAY ALL ERRONEOUS AND STRANGE DOCTRINE, CONTRARY TO
     GOD'S WORD; AND BOTH PRIVATELY AND OPENLY TO CALL UPON AND
     ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO THE SAME?---Ans. I AM READY, THE LORD
     BEING MY HELPER.

     Blessed be the good providence of GOD, who, in great compassion for
     this Church and Nation, has hitherto preserved us from heresies and
     schisms.

     O LORD, continue to us this great mercy, and grant that we, Who are
     appointed to watch over Thy flock, may employ our learning and our
     time in promoting of true piety; that we may never grow secure and
     careless, but that we may endeavour to secure the power, as well as
     the form of godliness. Have pity upon all Christian Churches, that
     are distracted by contending parties, and reduce all that wander out
     of the way. Enable us to preserve this Church in peace and unity by
     all means becoming the spirit of the Gospel. Keep us stedfast in the
     faith, that we may never be tossed about with any wind of doctrine,
     or the craft of men. Let the zeal and industry of those that are in
     error provoke us to be zealously affected in a righteous cause; in
     labouring to make men good, and in converting sinners from the error
     of their ways; which GOD grant for JESUS CHRIST'S sake.
     ---Amen.

     "But," the Bishop, "himself also, as his important affairs will
     permit him, shall use his best persuasion, and all good means he can
     devise, to reclaim both them and all other within his Diocese so
     affected."---Canon 66th.

     2 Tim. iv. 3. "The time will come when they will not endure sound
     doctrine, but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves
     teachers, having itching ears."

     N.B. We are now in these sad times, and it behoves all faithful
     Pastors to know it. It is not the doctrine of the Gospel, if it
     favours men's lusts. They that will not receive, or who reject,
     the truth, are often judicially punished with a greediness to
     receive errors, falsehoods, and fables.

     Ver. 5. "Watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, make full
     proof of (or fulfil) thy ministry." He that is wanting in any
     essential part, is wanting to his own salvation.

     LORD, Thou art just in all the troubles which Thou hast brought upon
     this Church and Nation. Yet, O LORD, have mercy upon us, and restore
     to us that peace and unity which we once enjoyed.

     Matt. vii. 20. "By their fruits ye shall know them.'' This
     rule, though given by CHRIST himself, is seldom observed. The best
     fruits are counted as nothing, are overlooked, and often condemned
     by those who have none good to show. Hence, all the evils the Church
     suffers.

     Matt. xiii. 25. "But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares
     among the wheat." O JESUS, awaken the Pastors of Thy flock, and open
     their eyes, that they may perceive the tares which choke the
     seed,---the wolves which destroy Thy sheep.

     A mixture of good and bad in the Church is necessary to instruct,
     exercise, purify, sanctify, and keep the righteous in humility.

     Matt. xiii. 29. "Nay, lest, while ye gather up the tares, ye root up
     also the wheat with them." A zeal not regulated by this prohibition,
     allows no time to the good to grow strong in goodness, or to the
     wicked to forsake their evil ways; but chooses rather to destroy the
     good, provided they can but destroy the bad.

     Rev. ii. 14, 20. "I have a few things against thee, because thou
     hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak
     to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat
     things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. Thou
     sufferest that woman Jezebel to teach and to seduce my servants to
     commit fornication.'' How dreadful is the government of
     the Church, wherein a man must answer for those sins which he does
     not hinder! To tolerate by silence those who favour and pro mote
     sin, JESUS CHR1ST rebukes in the persons of these Bishops.

     O my SAVIOUR ! Thou who givest me this warning, enable me to profit
     by it. Assist me, in this day of trial, effectually to oppose and
     suppress that spirit of impurity, idolatry, profane ness, and
     irreligion, which is broken in upon us.

     If for fear of offending men or from a false love of peace, we
     forbear to defend the truth, we betray and abandon it.

     Acts xxviii. 29. "And when he had said these things,---the Jews
     had great reasonings among themselves." A preacher of the truth is
     not to be blamed for the contests which it gives occasion to carnal
     men to raise. Even CHRIST Himself could not preach without
     disturbing sinners;---and if He came not to bring peace on earth,
     but a sword of division, His Ministers ought to expect to do the
     same.

     It is not by the heat of disputation, but by the gentleness of
     charity, that souls are gained over to GOD. And when controversy is
     necessary, as sometimes it is, let it never be managed with
     harshness, bitterness, or severity, lest it exasperate and harden,
     more than convert and edify. A prudent condescension has often
     prevailed upon the weak, and rendered them capable of hearkening to
     reason, when the contrary conduct would have removed them farther
     from the light. We ought to avoid evil men and seducers, in order to
     shame them;---to deprive them of that credit, whereby they may do
     hurt;---to make them to return to a right mind,---and that we
     may avoid the snare ourselves.

                                  Disputes.

     The primitive Fathers were ever modest upon religious questions.
     They contented themselves with resolving such questions as were
     proposed to them, without starting new ones; and carefully
     suppressed the curious, restless temper.

     May I receive from Thee, O GOD, at all times, the rules of my
     behaviour on these occasions.

     GOD judges otherwise than we do of these things. He knows the good
     He intends to bring out of evil,---either for the sanctification
     of the righteous,---conversion of the wicked, By His goodness in
     bearing with them,---or leaving them without excuse.

     One single soul is worth the utmost pains of the greatest Minister
     of CHRIST. But, then, let us take care, when it is brought into the
     fold, that he be a better Christian than before,---that he be not
     two-fold more the child of hell than before.
