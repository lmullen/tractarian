                                 LETTER IV.

                                 [Number 47]
     __________________________________________________________________

     I AM sorry my delay has been so considerable in answering your
     remarks on my Letters on the Church. Indeed it has been ungrateful
     in me, for you have given me an attention unusual with the multitude
     of religious persons; who, instead of receiving the arguments of
     others in simplicity and candour, seem to have a certain number of
     types, or measures of professing Christians, set up in their minds,
     to one or other of which they consider every one they meet with
     belongs, and who, accordingly, directly they hear an opinion
     advanced, begin to consider whether the speaker be a No. 1, 2, or 3,
     and having rapidly determined this, treat his views with
     consideration or disregard, as it may be. I am far from saying our
     knowledge of a person's character and principles should not
     influence our judgment of his arguments; certainly it should have
     great weight. I consider the cry "measures not men," to be one of
     the many mistakes of the day. At the same time there is surely a
     contrary extreme, the fault of fancying we can easily look through
     men, and understand what each individual is; an arbitrary classing
     of the whole Christian family under but two or three countenances,
     and mistaking one man's doctrine for another's. You at
     least have not called me an Arminian, or a high Churchman, or a
     Borderer, or one of this or that school, and so dismissed me. To
     pass from this subject. You tell me that in my zeal in advocating
     the doctrine of the Church Catholic and Apostolic, I "use
     expressions and make assumptions which imply that the Dissenters are
     without the pale of salvation." So let me explain myself on these
     points.

     You say that my doctrine of the one Catholic Church in effect
     excludes Dissenters, nay, Presbyterians, from salvation. Far from
     it. Do not think of me as of one who makes theories for himself in
     his closet, who governs himself by book-maxims, and who, as being
     secluded from the world, has no temptation to let his sympathies for
     individuals rise against his abstract positions, and can afford to
     be hard-hearted, and to condemn by wholesale the multitudes in
     various sects and parties whom he never saw. I have known those
     among Presbyterians whose piety, resignation, cheerfulness, and
     affection, under trying circumstances, have been such, as to make me
     say to myself, on the thoughts of my own higher privileges, "Woe
     unto thee Chorazin, woe unto thee Bethsaida! "Where little is given,
     little will be required; and that return, though little, has its own
     peculiar loveliness, as an acceptable sacrifice to Him who singled
     out for praise the widow's two mites. Was not Israel apostate
     from the days of Jeroboam; yet were there not even in the reign of
     Ahab, seven thousand souls who were "reserved," an elect remnant?
     Does any Churchman wish to place the Presbyterians, where, as in
     Scotland, their form of Christianity is in occupation, in a worse
     condition under the Gospel than Ephraim held under the Law? Had not
     the ten tribes the schools of the Prophets, and has not Scotland at
     least the word of God? Yet what would be thought of the Jew who had
     maintained that Jeroboam and his kingdom were in no guilt? and shall
     we from a false charity, from a fear of condemning the elect seven
     thousand, scruple to say that Presbyterianism has severed itself
     from our temple privileges, and undervalue the line of Levi and the
     house of Aaron? Consider our Saviour's discourse with the woman
     of Samaria. While by conversing with her He tacitly condemned the
     Jews' conduct in refusing to hold intercourse with the
     Samaritans, yet He plainly declared that "salvation was of the
     Jews." "Ye worship ye know not what;" He says, "we know what we
     worship." Can we conceive His making light of the differences
     between Jew and Samaritan?

     Further, if to whom much is given, of him much will be required, how
     is it safe for us to make light of our privileges, if we have them?
     is not this to reject the birth-right? to hide our talent under a
     napkin? When we say that God has done more for us than for the
     Presbyterians, this indeed may be connected with feelings of
     spiritual pride; but it need not. We may, by so saying, provoke
     ourselves to jealousy; for we dare not deny that, in spite of our
     peculiar privileges of communion with Christ, yet even higher saints
     may lie hid (to our great shame) among those who have not themselves
     the certainty of our especial approaches to His glorious majesty.
     Was not Elijah sent to a widow of Sarepta? did not Elisha cure
     Naaman? and are not these instances set for ward by our Lord Himself
     as warnings to us "not to be high minded but to fear;" and, again,
     as a gracious consolation when we think of our less favoured
     brethren? Where is the narrowness of view and feeling which you
     impute to me? Why may I not speak out, in order at once to admonish
     myself, and to attempt to reclaim to a more excellent way those who
     are at present severed from the true Church.

     And what has here been said of an established Presbyterianism, is
     true (in its degree) of dissent, when it has become hereditary, and
     embodied in institutions.

     Further, it is surely parallel with the order of Divine Providence
     that there should be a variety, a sort of graduated scale, in His
     method of dispensing His favour in Christ. So far from its being a
     strange thing that Protestant sects are not "in Christ," in the same
     fulness that we are, it is more accordant to the scheme of the world
     that they should lie between us and heathenism. It would be strange
     if there were but two states, one absolutely of favour, one of
     disfavour. Take the world at large, one form of paganism is better
     than another. The North American Indians are theists, and as such
     more privileged than polytheists. Mahometanism is a better religion
     than Hindooism. Judaism is better than Mahometanism. One may believe
     that long established dissent affords to such as are born and bred
     in it a sort of pretext, and is attended with a portion of blessing,
     (where there is no means of knowing better,) which docs not attach
     to those who cause divisions, found sects, or wantonly wander from
     the Church to the Meeting House;---that what is called an
     orthodox sect has n share of Divine favour, which is utterly
     withheld from heresy. I am not speaking of the next world, where we
     shall all find our selves as individuals, and where there will be
     but two states, but of existing bodies or societies. On the other
     hand, why should the corruptions of Rome lead us to deny her Divine
     privileges, when even the idolatry of Judah did not forfeit hers,
     annul her temple-sacrifice, or level her to Israel?

     I say all this, merely for the purpose of suggesting to those who
     are "weak" some idea of possible modes in which Eternal Wisdom may
     reconcile the exuberance of His mercy in Christ to the whole race of
     man, with the placing of it in its fulness in a certain ordained
     society and ministry. For myself I prefer to rely upon the simple
     word of truth, of which Scripture is the depository, and since
     Christ has told me to preach the whole counsel of God, to do so
     fearlessly and without doubting; not being careful to find ways of
     smoothing strange appearances in His counsels, and of obviating
     difficulties, being aware on the one hand that His thoughts are not
     our thoughts, nor our ways His ways, and on the other, that He is
     ever justified in His sayings, and overcomes when He is judged.
