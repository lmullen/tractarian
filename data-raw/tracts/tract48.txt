              BISHOP WILSON'S MEIDTATIONS ON HIS SACRED OFFICE.

     Question from the Office of Consecration
     .---WILL YOU DENY ALL UNGODLINESS AND WORLDLY LUSTS, AND LIVE
     SOBERLY, RIGHTEOUSLY, AND GODLY, IN THIS PRESENT WORLD, THAT YOU MAY
     SHOW YOURSELF IN ALL THINGS AN EXAMPLE OF GOOD WORKS UNTO OTHERS,
     THAT THE ADVERSARY MAY BE ASHAMED, HAVING NO THING TO SAY AGAINST
     YOU?---Ans. I WILL SO DO, THE LORD BEING MY HELPER.

     1 Cor. ix. 27. "I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection,
     lest, by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should
     be a castaway." And if Paul, what shall be said of us?

     Gal. v. 24. "They, that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh
     with the affections and lusts." Nature is content with a little,
     grace with less.

     Tit. ii. 15. "Let no man despise thee;" that is, demean thy self
     agreeable to the authority which thou hast received from Jesus
     Christ, not making thy office contemptible by any mean action; but
     act with the dignity of one who stands in the place of God.

     Lev. iv. 3. "If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the
     sin of the people, then let him bring a sin-offering." N.B. That the
     same sin, in a single priest, is to have as great a sacrifice as a
     sin of the whole people of Israel. The flesh never thrives but at
     the cost of the soul. Let us ever remember, that mortification must
     go further than the body. Self-love, pride, envy, jealousy, hatred,
     malice, avarice, ambition, must all be mortified, by avoiding and
     ceasing from the occasions of them. The sobriety of the soul
     consists in humility, and in being content with necessaries.

     Matt. vii. 14. "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, that
     leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." But, if the
     difficulties of an holy life affright us, let us consider, "who can
     dwell with everlasting burnings?" All mankind being under the
     sentence of death, certain to be executed, and at an hour we know
     not of, a state of penance and self-denial, of being dead and
     crucified to the world, is certainly the most suitable, the most
     becoming temper that we can be found in, when that sentence comes to
     be executed, that is, when we come to die.

     The more we deny ourselves, the freer we shall be from sin and the
     more dear to God. God appoints us to sufferings, that we may keep
     close to Him, and that we may value the sufferings of His Son, which
     we should have but a low notion of, did not our own experience teach
     us what it is to suffer. Had there been any better, any easier way
     to heaven, Jesus Christ would have chosen it for Himself and for His
     followers.

                              Take up the Cross.

     This is designed as a peculiar favour to Christians, as indeed are
     all Christ's commands. Miseries are the unavoidable portion of
     fallen man. All the difference is, Christians suffering in obedience
     to the will of God, it makes them easy; unbelievers suffer the same
     things, but with an uneasy will and mind. To follow our own will,
     our passions, and our senses, is that which makes us miserable. It
     is for this reason, and that we may have a remedy for all our evils,
     that Jesus Christ obliges us to submit our will, our passions, &c.
     to God. The good Christian is not one who has no inclination to sin,
     (for we have all the seed of sin in us,) but who being sensible of
     such inclinations, denieth them continually, and suffers them not to
     grow into evil actions. No pleasure can be innocent which hinders us
     from minding our salvation. We need but taste any pleasure a very
     little while, to become a slave to it. The only way to overcome our
     corrupt affections, is absolutely to deny their cravings. We have
     reason to suspect every doctrine which would teach us to avoid Sill
     without suffering, since the Holy Scriptures speak so much of
     self-denial, of the difficulty of working out our salvation.
     Self-denial is absolutely necessary to prepare us to receive the
     grace of God; it was absolutely necessary that John the Baptist
     should prepare the way, by preaching repentance and self-denial. Men
     need not be at pains to go to hell; if they will not deny
     themselves, if they make no resistance, they will go there of
     course. One does not begin to fall, when the fall becomes sensible.
     "They that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with the
     affections and lusts." This is the only true test of being truly
     Christians. Afflictions may make men esteem us less; but God loves
     us the more for them, if we bear them with resignation; which if we
     do, it is a certain sign of his grace and care of us. The yoke of
     Christ is not only safer, but even easier, than that liberty we are
     naturally fond of It makes the practice of virtue pleasant; frees us
     from the violence of corruption, from being ruined by false
     pleasures. Crosses make death less frightful. And indeed, he that
     will not obey Jesus Christ must obey his own passions, the world,
     its customs, humours, which are the worst of tyrants, and downright
     slavery. Every day deny yourself some satisfaction; your eyes,
     objects of mere curiosity; your tongue, every thing that may feed
     vanity, or vent enmity; the palate, dainties; the ears, flattery,
     and what ever corrupts the heart; the body, ease and luxury; bearing
     all the inconveniences of life, (for the love of God,) cold, hunger,
     restless nights, ill health, unwelcome news, the faults of servants,
     contempt, ingratitude of friends, malice of enemies, calumnies, our
     own failings, lowness of spirits, the struggle in overcoming our
     corruptions; bearing all these with patience and resignation to the
     will of God. Do all this as unto God, with the greatest privacy. All
     ways are indifferent to one who has heaven in his eye, as a
     traveller does not chuse the pleasantest, but the shortest and
     safest way to his journey's end; and that is, if we were to
     chuse for ourselves, the way of the cross, which Jesus Christ made
     choice of, and sanctified it to all his followers. It being much
     more easy to prevent than to mortify a lust, a prudent Christian
     will set a guard upon his senses. One unguarded look betrayed David.
     Job made a covenant with his eyes. Evil communications corrupt good
     manners. Sensuality unfits us for the joys of heaven. If that
     concupiscence which opposes virtue be lessened, a less degree of
     grace will secure innocence. All ways are indifferent to one who has
     heaven in his eye. Self-denial has respect to the good estate of the
     soul, as it hinders her from being carried away to the lower
     pleasures of sense, that she may relish heavenly pleasures. "The Son
     of Man hath not where to lay his head." (Matth. viii. 20.) This
     should fill us with confusion, whenever we are over-much concerned
     for the conveniences of life. Our affections being very strongly
     inclined to sensible good, for the sake of which we are often
     tempted to evil, and fall into great disorders, we should resolve to
     sacrifice our will to reason, and reason to the Word of God. God
     does not require it of us, that we should not feel any uneasiness
     under the cross, but that we should strive to overcome it by His
     grace.

                           Virtues of a Holy Life.

     Fervency in devotion; frequency in prayer; aspiring after the love
     of God continually; striving to get above the world and the body;
     loving silence and solitude, as far as one's condition will
     permit; humble and affable to all; patient in suffering affronts and
     contradictions; glad of occasions of doing good even to enemies;
     doing the will of God, and promoting His honour to the utmost of
     one's power; resolving never to offend Him willingly, for any
     temporal pleasure, profit, or loss. These are virtues highly
     pleasing to God. There is no pleasure comparable to the not being
     captivated to any external thing whatever. Self-denial does not
     consist in fasting and other mortifications only, but in an
     indifference for the world, its profits, pleasures, honours, and its
     other idols. It is a part of special prudence, never to do any thing
     because one has an inclination to it; but because it is one's
     duty, or it is reasonable; for he who follows his inclination
     because he wills, in one thing, will do it in another. He that will
     not command his thoughts and his will, will soon lose the command of
     his actions. Always suspect yourself, when your inclinations are
     strong and importunate. It is necessary that we deny ourselves in
     little and indifferent things, when reason and conscience, which is
     the voice of God, suggests it to us, as ever we hope to get the rule
     over our own will. Say not, it is a trifle, and not fit to make a
     sacrifice of to God. He that will not sacrifice a little affection,
     will hardly offer a greater. It is not the thing, but the reason and
     manner of doing it, viz. for God's sake, and that I may
     accustom myself to obey His voice, that God regards, and rewards
     with greater degrees of grace. (Life of Mr. Bonnell, p. 122.)

     Rom. xv. 3. "Even Jesus Christ pleased not Himself;" as appears in
     the meanness of His birth, relations, form of a servant, the company
     He kept, His life, death, &c. The greater your self denial, the
     firmer your faith, and more acceptable to God. The sincere devotion
     of the rich, the alms of the poor, the humility of the great, the
     faith of such whose condition is desperate, the contemning the world
     when one can command it at pleasure, continuing instant in prayer
     even when we want the consolation we expected: these, and such like
     instances of self-denial, God will greatly reward. They who imagine
     that self-denial intrenches upon our liberty, do not know that it is
     this only that can make us free indeed, giving us the victory over
     ourselves, setting us free from the bondage of our corruption,
     enabling us to bear afflictions (which will come one time or other),
     to foresee them without amazement, enlightening the mind,
     sanctifying the will. and making us to slight those baubles, which
     others so eagerly contend for.

     Mortification consists in such a sparing use of the creatures, as
     may deaden our love for them, and make us even indifferent in the
     enjoyment of them. This lessens the weight of concupiscence, which
     carries us to evil, and so makes the grace of God more effectual to
     turn the balance of the will. (Norris's Christian Prudence, p.
     300.) It is the greatest mercy, that God does not consult our
     inclinations, in laying upon us the cross, which is the only way to
     happiness. Jesus Christ crucified would have few imitators, if God
     did not lay it upon us, by the hands of men, and by His providence.
     "Let him deliver him now, if he will have him." (Matth. xxvii. 43.)
     Carnal man cannot comprehend that God loves those whom he permits to
     suffer; but faith teaches us, that the cross is the gift of his
     love, the foundation of our hope, the mark of his children, and the
     title of an inheritance in heaven. But unless God sanctify it by his
     Spirit, it becomes an insupportable burden, a subject of murmuring,
     and an occasion of sin.
