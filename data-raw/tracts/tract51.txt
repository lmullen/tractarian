                  ON DISSENT WITHOUT REASON IN CONSCIENCE.

                                 [Number 51]
     __________________________________________________________________

     As one mass doth contain the good ore and base alloy; as one floor
     the corn and the chaff; as one field the wheat and the tares as one
     net the choice fish and the refuse; as one fold the sheep and the
     goats as one tree the living and dry branches: so doth the Visible
     Church enfold the true universal. Church, called the Church mystical
     and invisible. And for this reason, and because presumptively every
     member of the Visible Church doth pass for a member of the
     invisible, (the time of distinction and separation being not yet
     come,) because this Visible Church, in its profession of truth, in
     its sacrifices of devotion, in its practice of service and duty to
     GOD, doth communicate with the invisible, therefore commonly the
     titles and attributes of one are imparted to the other."

     __________________________________________________________________

     IT is often asked, "Why should not a man attend both the Church and
     Meeting, if he derives benefit from both?" And again, "Why should
     not a man be a Dissenter, though he have nothing particular to
     object against the Church, if he is not violent in his opposition to
     the Church? The following remarks, in answer to these questions,
     were written by a clergyman for the, use of his parishioners.

     Many of you have made remarks to me on the subject of Dissent, when
     I have been visiting you in your cottages; and the substance of
     these remarks has apparently been, that it was of, very little
     importance, whether a man belonged to the Church, or dissented from
     it, because the difference, is after all: but small between
     Churchmen and Dissenters. You have thus spoken (as it would seem)
     sometimes with a view of drawing out my opinions, sometimes as a
     sort of defence or apology for your own. Sometimes in order to
     invite an argument. I have purposely in my answers abstained from
     entering into the question, and confined myself to saying simply,
     that I did not think as you did upon the matter. It would by no
     means have fallen in with the purpose for which I visited you on
     first coming to the parish, to have entered into any lengthened
     reasonings. My object in calling was to express my good-will towards
     you, and therefore to seek our points of agreement, and not our
     points of difference.

     At the same time you are not to suppose that I at all wish to
     conceal my sentiments, and it is because some of you may perhaps
     have an erroneous impression of what my opinion is on this subject
     that I now write this. My observations will be as short, as I can
     well make them. I shall avoid as much as possible any thing like
     controversy, or any expressions of opinion as to the relative merits
     of this or that form of dissent, or any discussion of the particular
     Articles of Faith (so far as there may be said to be such at all)
     among the several persuasions around us. Bear in mind, my object is,
     to show you that Dissent is a sin.

     But before I proceed further I must make two observations, which I
     wish you to keep in mind, while you read these remarks, because they
     will remove some difficulty, which you might otherwise feel in what
     follows.

     1. I allow there may be conscientious Dissenters, nay, I hope in
     charity, there are many;---but by a conscientious Dissenter I
     mean a man who separates himself from the Church, because he thinks
     he finds something in her doctrines or discipline so far contrary to
     scriptural truth and the precepts, of the Gospel, that by adhering,
     to: her, he would be putting an obstacle in the way of his own
     salvation. Other persons may think themselves conscientious
     Dissenters who do not go nearly so far in their condemnation of the
     doctrines or practice of the Church: nay, so far from it, that they
     would defend their Dissent upon the ground that there is no material
     difference between the system and teaching in the one, and the
     system and teaching in the other. But such men l do not call
     conscientious Dissenters, but careless or weak-minded persons, who
     cannot have thought much or seriously upon the subject, and who can
     hardly have read with attention what is to be found in the New
     Testament respecting the sin of schism, or on the unity of the
     Church, and the duty of obedience to it. Indeed a man out to
     consider very seriously what account he can give of his faith, who
     is far both Churchman and Dissenter, and so far disposed towards
     both, as to attend indiscriminately one or other place of worship;
     who also could give very little better explanation of the difference
     between one and the other, than a statement of the difference in the
     public services of each, and other particular matters of form, and
     of external observance. Such a person can neither be a true
     Churchman nor a conscientious Dissenter. He cannot be a true
     Churchman, for if he was he would not attending a Dissenting place
     of worship. For Dissent from the Church must imply a condemnation of
     something or other, be it of more or less importance, in the
     doctrines or discipline of the Established Church. and whoever
     attends service in a Meeting-house, when he has the opportunity of
     going to the Parish Church, does, by so doing, give his silent
     approbation to the principle of Dissent, and shows that at least he
     does not disapprove of the opinions of the particular body to whose
     Meeting he goes. He cannot be, on the other hand, a conscientious
     Dissenter, or he would not frequent the Church, i.e. a place of
     worship, which is supported by a system, which he considers one of
     injustice, and which excludes and condemns that to which he himself
     belongs; to say nothing about the probability of his hearing
     something, which, though not directly levelled against Dissent,
     still is in spirit a reproof and protest against it.

     When I say that Dissent is a sin, I by no means thereby imply, that
     for that reason every Dissenter if at once and necessarily a sinner.
     To say that a particular thing is a sin, is a very different thing
     from saying that every one who does it is a sinner. It will be as
     well to make this quite clear to you, and therefore I will give you
     some cases in which you would, without hesitation, make the same
     remark that I have done.---To kill a fellow-creature is
     undoubtedly a crime; but you would not say that the person who
     killed another by accident, or in defence of his country, or of his
     own life, or by command of lawful authorities, was criminal. There
     are, indeed, few deeds which are in a general way sins, which may
     not be committed under such circumstances as to rescue the person
     who did them from being on that account a sinner. There was once a
     nation which did not think thieving wrong: there is a nation which
     does not consider a parent's destroying a child, when too poor
     to maintain it, as a sin: and there is a class or sect in another
     nation who hold the same opinion as to the lives of their parents,
     when too old to be serviceable to themselves. You see from these
     illustrations that the degree of criminality attaching to a person
     for his actions, depends very much on the extent of knowledge he has
     of the nature of the act, his education, and various other
     circumstances. It is very difficult to weigh these exactly in
     estimating how far any particular person himself does wrong while he
     is committing a wrong act: GOD alone can see the heart; and,
     therefore, it is better to speak without immediate reference to
     persons, and only as to the character of the opinion or action under
     consideration.

     With these explanations, first, on the score of conscience causing
     it; next, of circumstances varying the degree of criminality in
     different persons; I repeat, Dissent is a sin, which I now go on to
     prove to you.

     Persons dissent from the Church on account of some difference or
     other, this is plain; and, from what I have already said, it is also
     plain that I do not intend to say any thing in what follows
     concerning the greater differences which cause Dissent, i.e.
     differences which are founded upon a different interpretation of
     Scripture. For when a man thinks the Church unscriptural, he has a
     good reason for leaving it, and is (what I have called above) a
     conscientious Dissenter; though at the same time I am bound to say,
     I think his conscience a very erroneous one, which leads him to
     consider the Church unscriptural; and while I allow him to be
     conscientious in one sense of the word, yet I also think him
     heretical,---just as those men who (as our LORD foretold)
     thought, when they persecuted the Apostles, "they did GOD service,"
     were wrong, not in that they obeyed their conscience, but because
     they had not a more enlightened conscience. "The light that is in" a
     merely conscientious Dissenter is (what CHRIST has called)
     "darkness." I say this before passing on to consider (as I mean to
     do) the other kind of Dissenters, those, viz. who dissent for some
     lesser difference, merely lest you should suppose that I consider a
     person absolved from all guilt, on the ground of his being
     conscientious; for as a good conscience is a great treasure, so a
     dark conscience is like the blind leading the blind. Now then let me
     address myself to that larger number of persons who have no material
     objection against the Church as to its doctrines or discipline, and
     who do not think that a Dissenter will be saved a bit more than a
     Churchman; who, indeed, are so far from condemning the Church, that
     they always feel rather disposed, when acknowledging their Dissent,
     to make a sort of apology or explanation for their leaving the
     Church, as e.g. that "it was so far to go to Church," or that "their
     health was weak," or "no good sittings were to be had," or that
     "they had an objection to the clergyman of the parish," or that
     "they were more edified by the service at Meeting, as more
     spiritual," or such reasons. I shall begin by placing before you
     some arguments, which indirectly support my assertion concerning the
     sinfulness of Dissent.

     (1.) Christians are required to unite in serving GOD in mutual
     charity and hearty concord. Hence such direction as these from the
     Apostles to different Churches, viz. that they should endeavour to
     keep "the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace," that they
     should be "like-minded, having the same love," being "of one accord,
     of one mind, standing fast in one Spirit with one mind," that they
     should "walk by the same rule, and mind the same thing," that "with
     one mind and one mouth they should glorify GOD, the Father of our
     LORD JESUS CHRIST," that they should "all speak the same thing,"
     that there should be "no divisions among them," but that they be
     "perfectly joined together in the same mind in the same judgment."

     As to the construction which some persons put on such passages, viz.
     by making them to refer to an unity in the spiritual sense, to a
     mystical union of the faithful all over the world, in the invisible
     Church of CHRIST, it is clearly inadmissible. For as a matter of
     reason, what can be the use of such strong and repeated exhortations
     to an union, whose only external sign is a profession of charitable
     indifference to all diversities of religious opinion, and whose
     principle bond of union, is a secret internal feeling, as to which
     no one can exactly judge his neighbour? And yet in the New
     Testament, direction are given concerning such divisions, as
     respecting a thing, of which every Christian can judge. And further,
     as a matter of fact, the Church or body, in which unity is
     preserved, is spoken of as a visible body, Vid Matt. xvi. 18; xviii.
     17. 1 Tim. iii. 15. 1 Cor. xii. Eph. iv. 4---12.

     (2.) Obedience to superiors is enjoined. This command seems to me,
     to give a double sanction to the legitimately appointed authorities
     of the Church. First, An authority indirectly, inasmuch as duty to
     the State requires of us obedience to all those who have the
     sanction of its authority for their dignities, provided always,
     obedience to them does not involve some sacrifice of principle, so
     as to be against our consciences. Hence, since the time that Church
     and State have been united, it becomes the duty of a good subject to
     pay reverence and obedience to the appointed ministers of religion,
     upon civil as well as upon religious grounds. Secondly, An authority
     directly, because obedience to spiritual superiors is separately
     enjoined. E. g. "Likewise ye younger; submit yourselves to the
     elder," 1 Pet. v. 5. :---(you will see from the first and second
     verses, that the elders mean spiritual superiors, who are set over
     you.) And again, "Submit yourselves unto such, and to every one,
     that helpeth with us, and laboureth." (1 Cor. xvi. 16.) "Obey them
     that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves, for they watch
     for your souls, as they that must give account." (Heb. xiii. 17.)
     Again, "We beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among
     you, and are over you in the LORD, and admonish you; and to esteem
     them very highly in love for their works' sake." (1 Thess. v.
     12, 13.)

     (3.) It is also a command to Christians, not to give a brother cause
     of sorrow and offence. Now any separation must do that. The question
     therefore is, whether the grounds for it are such as to compel us,
     from regard to our own souls, and even out of Christian charity to
     him, to separate from communion with the body to which he belongs,
     that we may thereby make him acquainted with the danger there is to
     his eternal salvation in remaining in a body, from which we feel
     obliged, for conscience sake, to come out. If we do not think we
     endanger our salvation by continuing in the Church, we are not
     justified for mere matters of opinion, and things, which we do not
     hold to be essentials of religion, to cast a reproach upon the body,
     from which we remove as from a thing unclean, and to give pain,
     doubts, and cause of dissensions, by thus withdrawing.

     I proceed next to some direct arguments in support of the assertion,
     that separation, as such, and when not on account of some
     fundamental doctrine, is a sin.

     1st. Hear what Scripture tells us should be our conduct towards
     those who cause divisions, and then consider, whether such persons
     are brought before us as exercising a proper liberty of choice.

     "We command you in the name of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, that ye
     withdraw yourselves from every brother, that walketh disorderly and
     not after the tradition which ye have received of us" (2 Thess. iii.
     6.)

     "If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive
     him not into your house, nor bid him GOD speed." (2 John x.)

     "These are they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
     Spirit." (Jude 19.)

     "I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and
     offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid
     them." (Rom. xvi. 17.)

     "If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words,
     even to the words of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and to the doctrine
     which is according to godliness; he is proud, knowing nothing, but
     doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy,
     strife, railings, evil-surmisings, perverse disputings of men of
     corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is
     godliness: from such withdraw thyself." (1 Tim. vi. 3---5.)

     2dly. Consider the manner they are represented in, who cause
     disunion in the Church. The terms are, indeed, so harsh to modern
     (so called) liberal notions, that one feels sure of incurring the
     reproach of being a bigot for venturing thus to apply what we read
     in Scripture; and the general view respecting these passages
     probably is, that the time of their application is quite gone by,
     and that they have long since become a dead letter. And yet,
     reflect, these terms are not used of persons, who were infidels, or
     heathens, or of those who corrupted the main doctrines of
     Christianity. St. Paul blames the Corinthians, because they
     expressed a preference for one teacher above another, and though
     they all taught the same thing, still he says of such a difference,
     "that there are contentions among you," and speaks of it as an
     evidence of their "carnal mind." (1 Cor. iii. 3.)

     3rdly. There are many passages in the Epistles, in which the ways,
     dispositions, and practices of false teachers are described,
     concerning which the learned differ much, and determine differently
     the sort of opinions condemned in them. Allowing, however, what
     weight is fair to this circumstance, yet after all look at them
     attentively with a view of finding whether they will give you any
     light for the guidance of your conduct in this matter; and, while
     you consider them, bear the following remarks in mind:---

     1. That which is condemned in these persons is either their
     professing false doctrine, or their making disorder, disturbance and
     disunion in the Church. If you think any of them apply to the
     second, then such passages apply to my argument here, because they
     go to prove, that making a separation and disputes in the Church is
     wrong.

     2. You will learn from some of them that a person may think himself
     quite sincere in leaving the Church, and, yet his own heart may have
     deceived him, thought it cannot deceive GOD, who will call him to
     account hereafter. 2 Tim. iii. 13. 2 Thess. ii. 11.

     3. You will see that heresy and schism are placed along with bas
     passions, and bad actions, and vicious dispositions, as if in some
     way connected with them, and as if we may therefore be called to
     give account for these opinions, just as much as for those actions,
     and passions, and dispositions of mind. 1 Tim. vi. 3. 20.; i. 3, 4.
     2 Tim. iv. 3.; iii. 13. Gal. i. 9. 2 Pet. ii. 18. 10.; iii. 16. Tit.
     i. 10.; iii. 10, 11. 2 Cor. xi. 13. 15. Acts xx. 20. Matt. vii. 15.
     2 Thess. iii. 6. 11. 2 John 9. Eph. iv. 14. Jude 16. Phil. i. 15,
     16.

     4thly. Consider the case of Korah in the Old Testament. He was a
     priest of the second order, and, with other Levites, withdrew his
     obedience from the High Priest. There was no matter of doctrine or
     worship in dispute between them and Aaron, nor any other dispute
     than that of Church government. And yet how terrible was his
     punishment. In his case we cannot evade the application to the
     Gospel times, because St. Jude makes it for us, speaking of those
     who "perish in the gainsaying of Core." Jude 11.

     5thly. When the Jews fell into wickedness and idolatry, priests as
     well as people, and GOD sent prophets to reprove them, yet none of
     these holy prophets did separate from communion with the wicked
     priests, and set up another priesthood in opposition to them. They
     did not think it lawful, how holy soever they were, to intrude
     themselves into the priesthood, as they had not been lawfully called
     and appointed.

     These two cases go very strongly to prove that there is a duty to
     submit ourselves, for conscience' sake, to the established
     order and manner in the Church, so long as the church enjoins
     nothing which plainly contradicts the revealed will of GOD, and to
     perform which would therefore do violence to our sense of right.

     6thly. Consider further, the ground upon which our SAVIOUR ordered
     the authority of the Scribes and Pharisees to be respected, viz.
     because they sat in Moses' seat (Matt. xxiii. 2.); i.e. because
     they were the lawfully appointed and regularly ordained ministers of
     the established religion. Moreover, throughout the acts of the
     Apostles, where we are to look for the use and gradual formation of
     s system of Church government, in proportion as the converts become
     more numerous, and more widely scattered in different countries, we
     may trace a principle of union and of subordination throughout the
     various Churches and Assemblies of believers. Care too was taken for
     the continuance of this union and this subordination, both in the
     manner of appointing teachers then, and in providing for their
     similar appointment for the time to come: and this manner of
     providing a due supply of fit persons for the ministry has been
     observed not only during the age of the Apostles, and their
     immediate successors, but it may be said through the first fifteen
     centuries after the establishment of Christianity.

     7thly, Turn to the solemn prayers of our SAVIOUS in the 17th chapter
     of St. John. "Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom
     thou hat given to me, that they may be one, as we are;" and again,
     the same prayer, "neither pray I for these alone, but for them also,
     which shall believe on Me, through their word, that they all may be
     one, as thou, Father, are in Me and I in Thee, that they also may be
     one in Us." . . . . Would it not be in direct opposition to the
     spirit and letter of this prayer to justify every individual
     Christian in claiming the right of withdrawing himself from
     communion with the Church upon every slight difference of opinion?
     As if Christianity required of us no surrender whatever of the
     private judgment, and as if it were never right for a Christian
     silently to acquiesce in existing usages, or new ordinances, in
     things indifferent, when commanded by lawful authority, unless he
     was convinced of the benefit and propriety of them, which would, in
     fact, be to make every individual Christian a law unto himself in
     all things; or, to adapt our language to the day, as if it were
     never required to assent in religious matters in the same way as in
     civil matters, i.e. without being convinced of the advisableness or
     benefit of the thing enjoined, but merely because, on the one hand,
     lawful authority orders it, and, on the other, we see no danger to
     our souls in obeying it.

     8thly. CHRIST hath given an authority to the Church, and therefore
     there is but one thing which can justify usin going against its
     authority, and that, a firm conviction, that by doing what the
     Church orders, we should transgress some still more evident and
     higher command of GOD: as, e.g. when the Church of Rome pronounced
     it lawful to take away the lives of excommunicated princes. and is
     not separating from the Church transgressing its authority?

     If any one ask, where is this authority spoken of in Scripture? let
     him consider the following texts.

     "He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you,
     despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth Him that sent me."
     (Luke x. 16.)

     "If he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an
     heathen man and a publican." (Matt. xviii. 17.)

     "Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and
     whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven."
     (Matt. xviii. 18.)

     "Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and
     whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained." (John xx. 23.)

     "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world." (Matt.
     xxviii. 20)

     9thly. CHRIST hath appointed the Church as the only way to eternal
     life. We read at the first, that the LORD added daily to the Church
     such as should be saved; and what was then done daily, hath been
     done since continually. CHRIST never appointed two ways to heaven;
     nor did He build a Church to save some, and make another institution
     for other men's salvation. "There is no other name under heaven
     given unto men, whereby we must be saved, but the name of JESUS:"
     and that is no otherwise given under heaven, than in the Church.


     Here, then, I finish my series of arguments. Not that there are not
     many others, which might be brought forward, to show that Dissent is
     wrong; but I prefer confining my remarks to those which have
     something in common with one another. The principles upon which all
     the reasonings here given are in some sort founded, are, 1. the
     Christian duty of obedience; 2. of preserving unity; 3. of avoiding,
     in all cases where we can, with a safe conscience, any giving
     occasion of offence, or pain, or perplexity, to our Christian
     brethren:---in other words, the duty of having an eye always to
     CHRISTIAN CHARITY, i.e. brotherly love, in our way of performing our
     duties, especially those about the limits of which we are not quite
     sure.

     The sum of the matter as here set before you is this. If a
     man's separation from the Church be upon grounds which he
     really believes to be of vital importance, I have nothing to do with
     him. He acts from conscientious motives, and cannot remain in
     communion with a Church, which teaches what he holds to be false
     doctrines. "To his own Master he standeth or falleth;" and it is not
     for me to judge how he has come to this conclusion. I can, however,
     fully understand, that so long as he holds such an opinion about our
     Church, he cannot have any thing to do with it, but must come out
     from it. But if I see a man attending the Church occasionally, as if
     he thought there was no positive harm in what is taught there, then
     I say, that man has not done rightly in becoming a Dissenter,
     because I gather from Scripture that it is a duty to submit to
     established authorities in religious matters, just as in political
     and civil matters, so long as there is no vital and essential
     difference between his own articles of faith, and those which the
     established Church maintains. He ought to submit in all things
     indifferent for conscience' sake. And his only sound and
     sufficient defence for separating from the Church, is a belief, that
     he cannot be saved in it on account of its holding false doctrine.
     If he cannot say this, he has no sufficient reason for thus "rending
     CHRIST'S body," by removing himself out of the Church, and for
     giving an example to others to set up some new sect for themselves
     upon any trifling ground of difference.

     I will add only one more remark in conclusion, which is this. You
     read in the New Testament of great and important promises made to
     the Church, whatever that Church be: you read also of many very
     strong and sharp rebukes given to those, who caused dissensions and
     disputes in the Church, during the time of the Apostles: you read
     also of the heavy condemnation, which will come upon those who have
     been partakers in these sins; and also you know the warnings of our
     SAVIOUR and of the apostles, that in the latter days, the danger and
     subtilty of these errors and heresies would increase, so as to
     deceive (if it were possible) even the elect; and, lastly, you know,
     that even though persons think they are conscientiously obliged to
     make a schism, still they may be condemned for this very false
     conviction of their deceitful hearts. Now, since all this is the
     case, would it not be prudent for a single man, who thinks of
     becoming a Dissenter, to consider seriously where he is most likely
     to come within the terms of these promises, and where he is least
     likely to be liable to the threats and denunciations above alluded
     to? Would it not be well to reason with himself somewhat on this
     wise: "The Church may not mean the Church, as some people understand
     it, who suppose that Dissenters are left out of it; but still as I
     never heard any one say, that the Dissenters were the only true
     Church, and that the Established Church was shut out of the
     promises, because she was no longer part of the true Church, surely
     I am more safe, more likely to come in for a share of these
     blessings, if, while in other things I strive to do my duty without
     troubling myself to decide things, which in truth are too hard for
     me, I continue a member of the Established Church. By so doing, I
     follow the example of my forefathers, of my country, of holy martyrs
     before me, and rest my faith on the authority of those, who are, by
     virtue of their office, successors of the Apostles; whereas, in the
     other case, I must, on my own judgment, set aside all this weight of
     authority, and do that, which is as much as to say, that till within
     the last thee hundred years the whole world has been in darkness,
     and that I can see clearer than all those great, and good, and
     pious, and learned persons, who have lived and died before in the
     faith." Surely it is the safer course to remain stedfastly in the
     Church, without halting between opinions; there is more chance of
     your being right there.

                                    NOTE.

     P.S. In order that you may know whom you ought to look upon as your
     proper spiritual guides and governors, I lay before you the
     description given of them by the famous Dr. Isaac Barrow. "Those, I
     say, then, who constantly do profess and teach that sound and
     wholesome doctrine, which was delivered by our LORD and his Apostles
     in a word and writing, was received by their disciples in the
     primitive Churches, was transmitted and confirmed by general
     tradition, was sealed by the blood of the blessed martyrs, and
     propagated by the labours of the holy fathers; the which also
     manifestly recommendeth and promoteth true reverence and piety
     towards GOD, justice and charity towards men, order and quiet in
     human societies, purity and sobriety in each man's private
     conversation.

     "Those who celebrate the true worship of GOD, and administer the
     holy mysteries of our religion, in a serious, grace, and decent
     manner, purely and without any notorious corruption, either by
     hurtful error, or supertitious foppery, or irreverent rudeness, to
     the advancement of GOD'S honour, and edification of the
     participants in virtue and piety.

     "Those who derive their authority by a continued succession from the
     Apostles, who are called unto and constituted in their office in a
     regular and peaceable way, agreeable to the institution of GOD, and
     the constant practice of His Church, according to rules approved in
     the best and purest ages; who are prepared to the exercise of their
     functions by the best education, that ordinarily can be provided
     under sober discipline, in the schools of the prophets; who thence,
     by competent endowments of mind and useful furniture of good
     learning, acquired by painful study, become qualified to guide and
     instruct the people; who, after previous examination of their
     abilities, and probable testimonies concerning their manners (with
     regard to the qualifications of incorrupt doctrine and sober
     conversation, prescribed by the apostles), are adjudged for the
     office; who, also, in a pious, grave, solemn manner, with invocation
     of GOD'S blessing, by laying on of the hands of the presbytery,
     are admitted thereunto.

     "Those whose practice in guiding and governing the people of GOD, is
     not managed by arbitrary, uncertain, fickle, private fancies or
     humours, but regulated by standing laws; framed (according to
     general directions extant in holy Scripture) by pious and wise
     persons, with mature advice, in accommodation to the seasons and
     circumstances of things, for common edification, order, and peace.

     "Those, who, by virtue of their good principles, in their
     dispositions and demeanour appear sober, orderly, peaceable,
     yielding meek submission to government, tendering the Church's
     peace, upholding the communion of the saints, abstaining from all
     schismatical, turbulent, and factious practices.

     "Those, also, who are acknowledged by the laws of our country, an
     obligation to obey whom is part of that human constitution unto
     which we are in all things (not evidently repugnant to GOD'S
     law) indispensably bound to submit; whom our Sovereign, GOD'S
     vicegerent, and the nursing father of His Church among us, (unto
     whom in all things high respect, in all lawful things entire
     obedience, is due,) doth command and encourage us to obey.

     "Those, I say, to whom this character plainly doth agree, we may
     reasonably be assured, that they are our true guides and governors,
     whom we are obliged to follow and obey; for what better assurance
     can we in reason desire? what more proper marks can be assigned to
     discern them by? what methods of constituting such needful officers
     can be settled more answerable to their design and use? how can it
     be evil or unsafe to follow guides authorized by such warrants,
     conformed to such patterns, endowed with such dispositions, acting
     by such principles and rules? Can we mistake or miscarry, by
     complying with the great body of GOD'S Church through all ages,
     and particularly with those great lights of the primitive Church,
     who, by the excellency of their knowledge, and the integrity of
     their virtue, have so illustrated our holy religion?"
