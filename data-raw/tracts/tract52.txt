     "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, and
     that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should
     remain."---St. John xv. 16.
     __________________________________________________________________

     THE service of this day invites us to consider the nature and
     commission of that ministry, by which Christians all over the world
     are made partakers of heavenly and spiritual blessings.

     On this point, as on most others, it is obvious that the New
     Testament does no where furnish a regular and orderly course of
     instruction, such as on many great subjects we find in our Creeds,
     Articles, and Catechism. But the mind and will of our Divine Master
     may be gathered plainly enough, at least by those who are willing to
     show a reasonable respect to the witness of the early Church.

     St. Luke, in the beginning of the Acts of the Apostles, informs us,
     that our LORD was not taken up, until "after that He, through the
     Holy Ghost, had given commandments unto the Apostles whom He had
     chosen;---being seen of them" at various times during as much as
     "forty days," and "speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom
     of GOD." Then, doubtless, He gave them instruction in what method
     and order to proceed, what kind of ministry to settle in His Church.
     Who would not wish to know what was the tenor of those
     conversations? But the Holy Ghost, in His unsearchable wisdom, has
     not seen fit directly to put them on record: an omission which
     appears very significant, when compared with the minute register
     which the Gospels supply of many former discourses. So it is, that
     on the occasion, which would seem to promise most information
     concerning the nature of CHRIST'S kingdom, instead of finding
     any report of what our blessed SAVIOUR said, we find a report of
     what His Apostles did. Their Acts and Letters take place of the
     desired memorial of His parting instructions. Is not this a hint to
     us all, on authority which cannot safely be despised, that we must
     look to the actual conduct and system of the early Church for a true
     notion of the things pertaining to "the kingdom of GOD," of which
     our LORD then spake to His Apostles. However early, on minute
     points, partial errors may have crept in, is it not evident to
     common sense, that the system which we trace back in the Church to
     the very generation next following the Apostles, must be in all
     great points the very system enjoined by our LORD, and partially
     disclosed in the subsequent history of His servants?

     It follows, that in order to make out our SAVIOUR'S will on any
     point relating to the discipline and proceedings of His Church, the
     first portion of Scripture to which our attention is directed is the
     Acts of the holy Apostles.

     Now, the very first Act of the Apostles, after CHRIST was gone out
     of their sight, was that commemorated this day;---the ordination
     of Matthias in the room of the traitor Judas. That ordination is
     related very minutely. Every particular of it is full of
     instruction; but at present I wish to draw attention to one
     circumstance more especially; namely, the time when it occurred. It
     was contrived (if one may say so) exactly to fall within the very
     short interval which elapsed between the departure of our LORD and
     the arrival of the Comforter in His place: on that "little while,"
     during which the Church was comparatively left alone in the world.
     Then it was that St. Peter rose and declared with authority that the
     time was come for supplying the vacancy which Judas had made. "One,"
     said he, "must be ordained;" and without delay they proceeded to the
     ordination. Of course, St. Peter must have had from our LORD express
     authority for this step. Otherwise it would seem most natural to
     defer a transaction so important until the unerring Guide, the Holy
     Ghost, should have come among them, as they knew He would in a few
     days. One the other hand, since the Apostles were eminently Apostles
     of our Incarnate LORD, since their very being, as Apostles, depended
     entirely on their personal mission from Him (which is the reason why
     catalogues are given of them, with such scrupulous care, in so many
     of the holy books):---in that regard one should naturally have
     expected that he Himself before His delegation would have supplied
     the vacancy by personal designation. But we see it was not His
     pleasure to do so. As the Apostles afterwards brought on the
     ordination sooner, so He had deferred it longer than might have been
     expected. Both ways it should seem as if there were a purpose of
     bringing the event within those ten days, during which, as I said,
     the Church was left to herself; left to exercise her faith and hope,
     much as Christians are left now, without any miraculous aid or
     extraordinary illumination from above. Then, at that moment of the
     New Testament history, in which the circumstances of believers
     corresponded most nearly to what they have been since miracles and
     inspiration ceased---just at that time it pleased our LORD that a
     fresh Apostles should be consecrated, with authority and commission
     as ample as the former enjoyed. In a word, it was His will that the
     eleven Disciples alone, not Himself personally, should name the
     successor of Judas; and that they chose the right person, He gave
     testimony very soon after, by sending His Holy Spirit on St.
     Matthias, as richly as one St. John, St. James, or St. Peter.

     Thus the simple consideration of the time when Matthias was
     ordained, confirms two points of no small importance to the
     well-being of CHRIST'S kingdom on earth. First, it shows that
     whoever are regularly commissioned by the Apostles, our LORD will
     consider those persons as commissioned and ordained by Himself.
     Secondly, it proves that such power to ordain is independent of
     those apostolical functions, which may be properly called extraneous
     and miraculous. It existed before those functions began; why then
     may it not still continue, however entirely they have passed away?

     We must not pretend to be wise above what is written; but there is,
     I trust, nothing presumptuous or unscriptural in supposing that
     JESUS CHRIST, the great Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, purposely
     abstained from nominating St. Matthias in his life-time, in order
     that Christians in all times might understand that the ordained
     successors of the Apostles are as truly bishops under Him, as ever
     the Apostles were themselves.

     For this is the constant doctrine of the ancient Church, delivered
     in express terms by our LORD in the text, "Ye have not chosen me,
     but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring
     forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain."

     It may seem strange that our LORD should deem it necessary to guard
     His Disciples against such a notion as that they had chosen Him,
     rather than He them: called as they had been, when they least
     expected it, from their daily employments of fishermen, publicans,
     and the like. But "for our sakes, no doubt, this is written;" to
     check an error which CHRIST foresaw would too generally prevail in
     His Church, especially in these latter days, which pride themselves
     so much on light and liberty. The error I mean is, that of imagining
     that Church communion is a voluntary thing, which people may adopt
     or no, (I will not say at their own pleasure, though too many go as
     far as that, but) as they seem to find it for the time most
     edifying. Another kindred notion is, that the Christian ministry is
     also a voluntary thing; that there is no real difference between
     clergy and laity, any more than is enacted by the law of the land
     for mere decency and order's sake; but that otherwise a man who
     can and will do good as a clergyman is to all intents and purposes a
     clergyman enough.

     These are not very uncommon notions. But take them at their best,
     and are they in effect any better than as if St. Paul and the other
     Apostles had considered themselves as choosing CHRIST instead of
     being chosen by CHRIST? He who reasons so, is he not chargeable with
     setting up his own calculation against the declared will and system
     of our LORD?

     Hear now on the other hand the very doctrine of the Church
     Apostolical. JESUS CHRIST, the chief Shepherd and Bishop, commits
     the pastoral office to whom He pleases; in the first place, to His
     Apostles, and after them, to all whom they, by the help of His
     ordinary grace, shall appoint; which latter proposition you have
     just heard clearly made out from the ordination of St. Matthias.
     Therefore, although there be many Bishops, yet the Episcopal office
     is but one. the lines of the true Catholic Church are drawn out, as
     the Psalmist says, to the ends of the world, over all lands; but
     trace them back, and they all meet in the same centre, JESUS CHRIST.
     Therefore it is all one Church, and not a thousand independent
     churches, as they would make it, who boast of choosing CHRIST,
     instead of humbly and thankfully acknowledging the choice which He
     has made of them, in that He has cast their lot within reach of His
     ministers and sacraments.

     This view, so clearly deducible from the promise of our LORD, and
     the conduct of His Apostles, is most unanswerably confirmed by the
     whole history of the Primitive Church. Every where the Bishops were
     the chief pastors, and the government and order of the Church was
     vested in them. To separate from them, except they were proved
     grossly heretical, was accounted schism. Why? Because it was
     universally understood, that the Bishops were the connecting chain
     which bound the successive generations of Christians to the first
     generation, the holy Apostles; nay, and to our LORD JESUS CHRIST
     Himself. For the believers of those days were made to the Church
     through the Apostles: so that if they broke off their connection
     with the Apostles, they broke off their connection with CHRIST.

     Would you hear some of the very words of those holy men of old? Take
     the following, which are part of a letter written by St. Ignatius,
     the friend of the chiefest of the Apostles, when he was on the verge
     of martyrdom. They are some of his last words, written to warn the
     friends for whom he was most anxious, against the heresies which
     were springing up in the Church.

     "By submitting yourself to your Bishop as to JESUS CHRIST, you
     convince me that you guide your lives by no rule of man's
     invention, but by the rule of JESUS CHRIST, who died for us, that
     ye, believing in His death, might escape altogether from death. It
     follows, of course, that in no part of your conduct ye separate
     yourselves from your Bishop: which thing also ye now practise."

     No test could be shorter or more simple. "You are in communion with
     your Bishop, humbly receiving from him, or those by him deputed, the
     genuine word and Sacraments of JESUS CHRIST: therefore, I make no
     question but you are also in communion with our LORD JESUS CHRIST
     Himself; at least, as far as Church Privileges go; as far as I or
     man can judge."

     Surely the holy martyr, St. Ignatius, was as good a judge of what
     Christian communion depends on, as any person can be supposed in our
     days. And we see that he judges of it, not by those tests which we
     now hear most insisted on; not by convictions, and emotions, and
     highly-wrought feelings; but by the simple fact of adherence to that
     system, which our LORD himself has established for our salvation.
     Now, we know from every page of St. Ignatius, what his view of that
     system was. It was the system of Christian ordinances, administered
     by Bishops, with Priests and Deacons under them. That, in the mind
     of St. Ignatius, was the sure mark of the Church of GOD.

     Nor was this a mere private opinion of his: it was rather the
     constant tradition of the Church Universal. what is very remarkable,
     it was the tradition not only the sound part of the Church, but of
     the heretics also. In those early days, even those who corrupted the
     doctrine of the Church seldom or never dared to breathe any thing
     against the Apostolical Succession of her Bishops. To do so, if they
     possibly could, would have been greatly to their purpose; because
     one very plain argument by which their misrepresentations of
     doctrine used to be confuted, was by appealing to the traditional
     account of the same doctrines, preserved in many of the most famous
     Churches, by means of the regular succession of Bishops. Some of the
     Fathers thus reckon up the Bishops of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch,
     for more than three hundred years, from the time of the Apostle, and
     are thereby enabled to trace back as far the true interpretation of
     certain hard places of Scripture, relating to the great truths of
     the Gospel. The heretics who disputed those truths, no doubt, would
     have been too happy, could they have proved that the chain of
     tradition wanted a link; that the succession from the Apostles was
     not clearly made out, or that being made out, it signified nothing.
     But the ground they used to take was quite different. they never
     dreamed of denying the past succession: it was too certainly known
     to be denied; but they took very great care to secure a future
     succession for themselves. They hardly ever broke off from the
     Church, until they had got some Bishop to patronize their heresy:
     through whom they might continue the Apostolical commission in a
     line of pastors of their own.

     Thus as well the enemies of the Church as her friends bore witness
     in those early days to a truth which too many of both seem now
     agreed on forgetting: That Episcopal Authority is the very bond
     which unites Christians to each other and to CHRIST: so that it was
     apparently a kind of proverb with them, Without the Bishop do
     nothing in the Church.

     What is more, the teaching of the Primitive Church brought this
     matter home to every man's own soul, not only on the general
     ground of submission to all our LORD'S ordinances, but because
     the bread and wine in the Eucharist was not accounted the true
     Sacrament of CHRIST, without CHRIST'S warrant given to the
     person administering: which warrant, the Fathers well knew, could
     only be had through His Apostles and their successors.

     Hear again the same St. Ignatius. "Let that LORD'S Supper be
     counted a LORD'S Supper indeed, which is ministered by the
     bishop, or by one having his commission." Observe, Ignatius, the
     friend of the Apostles, reckons the Sacrament no Sacrament, if the
     consecrating minister want the Bishop's commission. Could St.
     Ignatius possibly mistake the mind of the Apostles on that point, he
     who had conversed familiarly with them at the time when the Church
     was used to "continue daily in breaking of bread?"

     And with him agreed the whole Church of GOD for the first fifteen
     hundred years: knowing that when our LORD said, "Do this in
     remembrance of Me," His Apostles only were present; therefore non
     but they and their deputies could be said to have His warrant for
     blessing that bread and cup. And this is a matter pertaining to each
     man's salvation. For that bread and cup are the appointed mean,
     whereby the faithful are to partake of CHRIST'S Body and Blood
     offered for their sins.

     Can any devout man, considering this, reckon it a matter of small
     moment, whether the minister with whom he communicates be a minister
     by apostolical succession or no? In the judgment of the Church it
     makes no less difference than this: Whether the bread and cup which
     he partakes of shall be to him CHRIST'S Body and Blood or no. I
     repeat it: in the judgment of the Church, the Eucharist administered
     without apostolical commission, may to pious minds be a very
     edifying ceremony, but it is not that blessed thing which our
     SAVIOUR graciously meant it to be: it is not "verily and in deed
     taking and receiving" the Body and Blood of Him, our Incarnate LORD.

     Even as St. Paul seems to intimate, when he so pointedly asks the
     Corinthians, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the
     Communion of the Blood of CHRIST? The bread which we break, is it
     not the Communion of the Body of CHRIST? Why such a stress on the
     words, "which we bless," "which we break;" except because the
     Corinthians knew (and they could only know by Apostolical teaching),
     that the agency of the Apostles in blessing and breaking was needed
     to assure us that the holy signs really convey the thing signified?

     Thus you see every thing concurs; the ordination of St. Matthias,
     the promise of our LORD, the hints found elsewhere in holy
     Scripture, the express laws of the Universal Church, the constant
     doctrine of the friends of the Apostles;---all agree to show that
     Communion with GOD incarnate, such Communion as He offers in His
     holy Supper, cannot be depended on without an Apostolical Ministry.

     To think otherwise is the error of those, who, mixing up human
     inventions with the everlasting Gospel, take upon them to "choose
     CHRIST," instead of humbly owning themselves "chosen by Him," and
     labouring to bear fruit accordingly.

     But still more fatal will be our error, if having this high
     privilege, we cause it to be reproached by our abuse or negligent
     using. We, by GOD'S blessing, are among those, who, through an
     Apostolical Ministry, have constant access to the Body and Blood of
     our REDEEMER. What if we be found no more exemplary, no humbler, no
     more constant in our piety, than those whose possession of the means
     of grace is so much more questionable than ours? There is a
     prophetic warning against such: "You only have I know of all the
     families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your
     iniquities." There is also yet a more awful warning from Him who
     will come to be our Judge: "Thou, Capernaum, which are exalted unto
     Haven, shalt be brought down to hell; for if the mighty works which
     have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have
     remained until this day. But I say unto you, that it shall be more
     tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for
     thee."
