                              CHURCH DISCIPLINE.

     Question from the Office of Consecration
     .---WILL YOU MAINTAIN AND SET FORWARD, AS MUCH AS IN YOU LIETH,
     QUIETNESS, LOVE, AND PEACE, AMONG ALL MEN; AND SUCH AS BE UNQUIET,
     DISOBE DIENT, AND CRIM1NOUS WITHIN YOUR DIOCESE, CORRECT AND PUNISH,
     ACCORDING TO SUCH AUTHORITY AS YOU HAVE BY GOD'S WORD, AND AS
     TO YOU SHALL BE COMMITTED BY THE ORDINANCES OF THIS REALM?---Ans.
     I WILL SO DO, BY THE HELP OF GOD.

     O GOD of peace and love, make me, thy minister, a messenger and
     instrument of peace to this people to whom I am sent; that by thy
     gracious assistance I may root out all strife and variance, hatred
     and malice, and that this Church and Nation may enjoy a blessed
     tranquillity. Bless the discipline of this Church in my hands, and
     make it effectual for the conviction of wicked men and gainsayers.
     Assist me, by thy good Spirit, that I may apply a proper cure to
     every disorder; that I may reprove with mildness, censure with
     equity, and punish with compassion.

     O merciful GOD, who wouldest not the death of a sinner, but that he
     should be converted and live, bring into the right way all such as
     are gone astray from thy commandments. Vouchsafe unto all penitents,
     (and especially unto all such as are now under the censures of the
     Church,) a true sense of their crimes, true repentance for them, and
     thy gracious pardon, that their souls may be saved in the day of the
     LORD JESUS. Amen.

     Church Discipline.

     However the Church be in some respects incorporated with the
     commonwealth in a Christian state, yet its fundamental rights remain
     distinct from it; of which this is one of the chief---to receive
     into, and to exclude out of the Church, such persons which,
     according to the laws of the Christian Society, are fit to be taken
     in, or shut out.

     And when temporal laws interpose, it is temporal punishment only,
     which they design to inflict or set aside. Bishop Stillingfleet.

     Ezek. ii. 6. "And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither
     be afraid of their words; thou shalt speak my words unto them,
     whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear."

     2 Cor. xiii. 10. "Lest I should use sharpness, according to the
     power," (namely, of binding and loosing,) "which GOD hath given me
     to edification, and not to destruction."

     1 Tim. i. 20. "Whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may not
     blaspheme." O admirable use and command of Satan! He is GOD'S
     enemy, and yet does Him service; and an adversary to man, and yet
     helps to save him. He is the author of blasphemy, and yet teacheth
     not to blaspheme. That is, One that is stronger than he directs his
     malice to ends which he did not intend. Satan is set on work to take
     him down by terror and despair whom before he had tempted to sin.
     But while Satan thinks to drive him to destruction by despair, GOD
     stops his course, when the sinner is sufficiently humbled; and then,
     as it was with CHRIST, Satan is dismissed, and Angels come and
     minister unto him.---Rouse.

     What great man shall we now find, who will not take it ill to be
     reproved? and yet David, a prince and favourite of GOD, when he was
     reproved, even by a subject, did not turn away in a rage, but
     confessed his fault, and repented truly of his sin.--- St.
     Ambros. ap. David.

     The very office of Consecration, so often confirmed by Acts of
     Parliament, does warrant every Bishop, in the clearest and most
     express terms, to claim authority, by the Word of GOD, to exercise
     all manner of spiritual discipline within his own diocese.---
     Codex Jur. Eccl. Angl. p. 18.

     Men should be persuaded, not forced, to forsake their sins; because
     GOD rewards not those who, through necessity, forsake their sins;
     but such as do so voluntarily.---Chrysost.

     Be steady and fearless in the discharge of your duty, without
     failing in that respect which is due to higher powers.

     Grant, O GOD, that I may have an eye to duty only, that I may fear
     no temporal evil, and be concerned only lest I should not in all
     respects please Thee my GOD.

     Deut. i. 17. "The judgment is GOD'S." As this should oblige all
     people to be afraid of a judgment or censure passed by men
     commissioned by GOD, so it should make us very careful that our
     judgment be such as is worthy of GOD, and agreeable to His will and
     Word.

     1 Cor. xvi. 22. "If any man love not the LORD JESUS CHRIST, let him
     be Anathema Maranatha." Here is a positive direction to the Church
     to excommunicate all such as plainly discover that they have no love
     for JESUS CHRIST,---who are scandalous or profane.

     Since we are to give an account of the souls committed to our
     charge, we cannot be debarred of making use of all the means
     enjoined us by the Gospel to reduce sinners.

     We ought to be thankful for the favours which we have received from
     religious princes; but if our benefactors require of us what is
     inconsistent with our trust, we then know whom we are to obey.

     2 John 10, 11. "If there come any unto you and bring not this
     doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him GOD
     speed,---for he that biddeth him GOD speed, is partaker of his
     evil deeds." Not to show our abhorrence of sin, is to con sent to
     it. Men do not sufficiently consider the guilt of this, when they
     converse with notorious offenders without scruple. They partake with
     them in their sins; they harden the sinner; they forget the fidelity
     they owe to GOD and to His laws, and greatly hazard their own
     salvation.

     Excommunication was never pronounced except where the case was
     desperate, by the obstinacy of the party, in refusing admonition,
     and to submit to discipline.---Penit. Disc. p. 41, 42, 75, 120.

     Luke xv. 22. "The Scribes and the Pharisees murmured, saying, This
     man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them." On some occasions, we
     ought to avoid sinners, for fear of being corrupted,---or to put
     them to shame, in order to their conversion. But to converse with
     them, as our LORD did, in order to teach them their duty, to
     encourage them in the way of piety, &c. this is Godlike.

     Mark viii. 33. "Get thee behind me, Satan.---Thou savourest not
     the things that be of GOD, but the things that be of man." How
     dangerous is tenderness in matters of salvation! To spare a
     penitent, is to ruin him by a fatal kindness.

     How perilous is the government of the Church, wherein a man becomes
     guilty of those things which he does not hinder. Rev. ii. 20. "I
     have a few things against thee, because thou sufferedst that woman
     Jezebel to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication,"
     &c. 2 Cor. x. 4. "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but
     mighty through GOD, to thc pulling down of strongholds." We surely
     mistake the spirit of the Gospel, when we would establish and defend
     the Church by human policy, and carnal means, by friendship of great
     men, credit, reputation, splendour, riches, &c. GOD will have us to
     use other sort of arms, namely,---patience, humility, meekness,
     prayers, suffering, and spiritual censures, to which GOD will join
     His own Almighty power.

     All mankind are agreed that human legislatures can only dispense and
     make laws in cases purely human.
