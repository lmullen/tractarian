                              CHURCH DISCIPLINE.

                                 (Continued.)

     There is a public absolution, which is no more than a relaxation of
     a censure. There is no relation betwixt that and the absolution of
     sins.

     GOD ratifies in heaven the judgments of His ministers on earth, when
     they judge by the rules prescribed by His Word.

     Whenever Church discipline meets with discountenance, impieties of
     all kinds are sure to get head and abound. And impieties,
     unpunished, do always draw down judgments.

     The same JESUS CHRIST who appointed baptism, for the receiving men
     into His Church and family, has appointed excommunication to shut
     such out as are judged unworthy to continue in it.

     Matt. xviii. 15, &c. "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go
     tell him his fault between thee and him alone. If he shall hear
     thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee,
     then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or
     three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall
     neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church; but if he neglect to
     hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a
     publican. Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth,
     shall be bound in heaven; and what soever ye shall loose on earth,
     shall be loosed in heaven." So that if baptism be a blessing,
     excommunication is a real punishment: there being the same authority
     for excommunication as for baptism. And if men ridicule it, they do
     it at the peril of their souls.

     In short, this authority is necessary, if it is necessary to pre
     serve the honour of religion. It is appointed by JESUS CHRIST. The
     ends proposed by it are, to reform wicked men, and to remove
     scandals. If the sentence is duly executed, the offender is really
     deprived of the ordinary means of salvation. It is in deed a
     sentence passed by men, but by men commissioned by GOD Himself; that
     is, by the HOLY GHOST.

     The authority of CHRIST is to be respected in the meanest of His
     ministers.

     Excommunication
     , the most dreadful punishment which a Christian can suffer, becomes
     less feared than it ought to be, through the countenance which
     excommunicated persons meet with, contrary to the express command of
     GOD, "With such a one, no not to eat."

     A true penitent will be willing to bear the shame of his sins (where
     he has given offence) before men, that he may escape the confusion
     of them hereafter. But then he ought to know, that to submit to the
     outward part of penance, is not to submit to GOD, unless it proceed
     from the fear and love of GOD.

     A man may see his sin, confess it, abhor it, and yet be a false
     penitent. Judas did all this. What he wanted was the grace of GOD,
     to see the mercy of GOD, as well as His justice.

     Those who are first to lead men into sinful courses, seldom trouble
     themselves to recover them out of them. The ministers of CHRIST must
     do it, or they must die in their sin.

     Mark v. 4. "And they laughed him to scorn." O, my Lord and Master!
     let me not be driven from my duty, by the infidelity and scoffs of
     the world.

     How desperate soever the condition of a sinner may appear, we must
     neither insult over it, nor despair of his conversion.

     A person who has offended and scandalized others by his sins, ought,
     before he be admitted to the peace of the Church, and to receive the
     Sacrament, to give some good ground of assurance, by a sober life,
     that he is a true penitent.

     Mark vi. 1. "Shake off the dust under your feet, for a testimony
     against them." Jesus CHRIST permits not His Apostles to avenge
     themselves by their Apostolical power, nor even to desire that He
     should do it; but to leave their cause to GOD, with full confidence
     in Him.

     Luke xix. 8. "And if I have taken any thing from any man by false
     accusation, I restore him fourfold." The judgment, which, of his own
     accord, this penitent passes upon himself, will condemn those who
     reject all the remedies offered, and all methods made use of, for
     their conversion, and who will not make the least atonement for
     their crimes. Men show very plainly that they love sin, when they
     will not suffer any one to put a stop to it, to remove the occasions
     thereof; and to shame, to reprove, and to punish the sinner. This is
     a sin which draws after it great judgments.

     If a pastor hopes to do his duty without reproving the world,
     (without testifying that the works thereof are evil; John vii. 7.)
     or to reprove it without being hated by it, he will deceive himself;
     he may carry it fair with men, but will be condemned by JESUS
     CHRIST.

     John viii. 7. "He that is without sin among you, let him cast the
     first stone." They whose duty it is to punish offenders, should take
     great care not to be influenced by pride, hypocrisy, passion, false
     zeal, or malice; but to punish wish reluctancy; with compassion, as
     having a sense of their own misery and weakness, which, perhaps,
     render them more guilty in the sight of GOD. Let Ecclesiastical
     Judges always remember, that the HOLY GHOST, to whom it belongs to
     bind and loose, never makes Himself the minister of the passions of
     men.

     John xii. 43. "They loved the praise of men more than the glory of
     GOD." And this is the cause that men count it more shameful to
     acknowledge their crimes than it was to be guilty of them.

     We must never insult a sinner; but, without extenuating his sin, we
     must comfort him, by showing him the good which GOD may bring out of
     it.

     Acts viii. 3. "As for Saul, he made havock of the Church." The
     designs of GOD toward Saul should teach us not to despair of any
     man's conversion, but to pray for it, and to use our best
     endeavours, instead of being angry, and using them ill.

     Acts ix. 9. "And Saul was three days without sight, and neither did
     eat nor drink." JESUS CHRIST Himself, in this instance, teaches His
     ministers not to be too hasty in receiving penitents, but to let
     them fast and pray, and bear the sense of their sin, and of their
     bad condition, before they be reconciled. It teaches penitents to
     fast and pray, and to bear with patience the fruit of their own
     doings,

     Acts xix. 18. "Many that believed, came and confessed their deeds,"
     &c. The Spirit of Grace always inclines men to confess their evil
     deeds, and humble themselves for their sins. There could not be a
     more shameful one than dealing with the devil, &c. yet this did not
     hinder them,---or from sacrificing the most valuable things that
     had been instruments in their wickedness. This is a proof of a true
     conversion, &c.

     The fall of others, is for us a great instruction, and a lesson
     which we ought to study, not in order to insult our neighbour, but
     to fear for, and amend, ourselves.

     Let us not despise any sinner. GOD has sometimes very great designs
     in relation to those who are at present most opposite to Him.

     To reprove, when persons are not in a proper disposition for
     amendment, would be to give both them and ourselves trouble without
     any prospect of advantage. To make reproof beneficial, they to whom
     it is given should see that it does not proceed from humour, or from
     a design to vex them, but from a true zeal and love for their souls.

     A true charity will never insult those that are gone astray, but
     will use the greatest sinners mildly, lest they should be driven to
     despair by too great severity.

     The Church forgives sins "in the person of CHRIST" (2 Cor. ii. 10.)
     She remits the temporal punishment of them also, be cause CHRIST is
     the Sovereign High Priest, and because it belongs to GOD alone to
     recede from the strictness of His justice, in what manner He thinks
     fit. An ecclesiastical governor should endeavour to preserve
     discipline, and the esteem of his people, at the same time, by acts
     of tenderness, &c.

     2 Cor. x. 8. "For though I should boast of my authority, (which the
     LORD hath given us for edification, and not for destruction,) I
     should not be ashamed." It is necessary, sometimes, to extol the
     dignity of our office. N. B. Pastors are appointed by CHRIST to
     edify the Church; they must, therefore, be honoured and obeyed.

     The disorders which a good pastor observes in his flock, will always
     be matter of humiliation to him, because he will always impute them
     to himself. A pastor, a priest, who does not, with tears and
     supplications, bewail the sins of his people, cannot call himself
     their mediator with GOD.

     It is the greatest comfort of a good pastor, to feel himself obliged
     to use nothing but good advice, and the mild part only of his
     authority; but when that will not do, he must "use sharpness;" but
     still, with this view, that it be for their edification, not for
     their destruction.

     It seldom happens that great men, whether clergy or laity, reform
     their lives, because they seldom meet with persons of courage to
     oppose them, or to tell them of their faults. A Bishop who is not
     restrained by any earthly engagements, will not spare any man whose
     conduct is prejudicial to the faith.

     Gal. v. 12. "I would they were even cut off which trouble you." To
     wish shame, or some temporal evil, for the salvation of our
     neighbour's soul, is not contrary to charity. It seems, matters
     were come to a great height of evil, when St. Paul was forced to
     wish that to be done, which he did not, in prudence, think fit to
     do.

     Ecclus. viii. 5. "Reproach not a man that turneth from sin, but
     remember that we are all worthy of punishment."

     2 Thess. iii. 6. "Now we command you," (and the same authority
     subsists still in the governors of the Church,) "in the name of our
     LORD JESUS CHRIST, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother
     that walketh disorderly," &c. Nothing is there which the faithful
     ought more carefully to avoid, than disorderly livers,---nothing
     which pastors ought more earnestly to warn their flocks of.

     May I ever observe the rules of an holy and charitable severity.

     2 Thess. iii. 14. "And if any man obey not our word, note that man,
     and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed; yet count him
     not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother." Excommunication is
     only for the contumacious,--- not to insult, but to cure.

     1 Tim. v. 19. "Against an elder receive not an accusation, but
     before two or three witnesses." A pastor ought not lightly to be
     exposed to the revenge of those, whom it is probable he has, or
     shall have, occasion to reprove.

     1 Tim. v. 20. "Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may
     fear." That is, who sin grievously and are convinced before two or
     three witnesses---let such be censured, before, or by the consent
     of, all the congregation.

     2 Tim. ii. 25. "In meekness instructing," (reproving) " those that
     oppose themselves,---if GOD peradventure will give them
     repentance," &c. When we consider that repentance is the gift of
     GOD---that the wiles of the devil are many, and corruption of
     nature very strong, we shall compassionate instead of insulting a
     sinner. We shall adore the mercy of GOD towards ourselves, and hope
     for it for others. We shall tear for ourselves, and pray for them.
     They may recover, and be saved. We may fall, and be lost for ever.

     When men will not take care of their own salvation, the Church owes
     this care to her children, to hinder them as much as possible from
     ruining others.

     If excommunication is perpetual, it is caused by the obstinacy of
     the offender, not by the laws of CHRIST, or His Church, which only
     deprives wicked men of the benefit of communion for a time, to bring
     them to a sense of their duty. Church discipline is for the honour
     of GOD, for the safety of religion, the good of sinners, and for the
     public weal---that Christians may not run headlong to ruin
     without being made sensible of their danger,---that others may
     see, and fear, and not go on presumptuously in their evil
     ways,---that the house of GOD may not become a den of thieves,
     ---and that judgments may not be poured down upon the whole
     community. Josh. xxii. 20. Did not Achan commit a trespass, and
     wrath fell on all the congregation?

     The most effectual way of answering these ends is, to exercise
     strict impartial discipline. First, to withhold from Christians the
     benefit of the Holy Sacrament, till they behave themselves so as to
     be worthy of so great a blessing. And, secondly, if they continue
     obstinate, (all proper methods being used to reclaim them,) to
     excommunicate them; and to oblige all sober Christians not to hold
     familiar conversation with them. But first of all, Christians should
     be made sensible of what blessings they are deprived, when they are
     debarred the communion,---even the greatest on earth; without
     which they can have no hopes of salvation, but must perish
     eternally, John vi. 53.

     He that understands and believes this, will submit to any hardships,
     rather than incur, rather than continue under, a sentence so full of
     terror; and a sentence passed by one commissioned by GOD; and bound,
     at the peril of his soul, to pass it, it being the greatest
     indignity to CHRIST and the divine ordinance, to prostitute the body
     and blood of CHRIST, to notorious evil livers. GOD has therefore
     lodged a power in the pastors of His Church, to repel all such; and
     it is a mercy even to them to be hindered from increasing their
     guilt and their damnation.

     Nor can any prince, governor, nor human law, hinder a Christian
     Bishop from exercising this power, because he is under an obligation
     to the KING of kings and LORD of lords to do his duty in this
     respect.

     Nor must it be pretended, that the punishment which Christian
     Magistrates inflict may supersede this discipline. Those punishments
     only affect the body, and keep the outward man in order. These are
     designed to purify the soul, and to save that from destruction.
     Excommunication, as St. Paul tells us, (1 Cor. v. 5.) is "for the
     destruction of the flesh, that the soul may be saved;" that is, to
     mortify the corruption of nature, lust, pride, intemperance, &c.;
     this being the only way to save the soul of the sinner, and to bring
     him to reason, that is, to repentance.

     For upon a sinner's repentance, (unless where he has incurred
     the sentence more than once,) the Church is ready to receive him
     into her bosom, with open arms. But then by repentance must be
     understood, not a bare change of mind; not an acknowledgment of the
     sin and scandal; not a serious behaviour for a few days;---all
     which may soon wear off; but, a course of public trial of sincerity,
     such as may satisfy a man's self, and all sober Christians,
     that the sinner is a true penitent: that he has forsaken all his
     evil ways, evil company, evil habits; that he is grown habitually
     serious, devout and religious,---and that by fasting and prayer,
     he has, in some good measure, got the mastery of his corrupt nature,
     and has begun a repentance not to be repented of.

     For want of this care and method, many Christians are ruined
     eternally. They sin and repent, and sin again, and think all is
     safe, because they have repented, as they think, and are pardoned.

     There are people who are in the same sad case with those that stand
     excommunicated, though no sentence has passed upon them, namely,
     such as live in a contempt of the public worship of GOD. They cannot
     properly be turned out of the Church, who never come into it, but
     they keep themselves out of the ark, and consequently must perish.

     Excommunication, in the primitive times, was pronounced in the
     congregation to which the offender belonged. After which, they gave
     notice to all other Churches; namely, ;let no temple of GOD be
     open to him, let none converse with him, &c.

     2 Sam. xii. 13, 14. "And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned
     against the LORD. And Nathan said, the LORD also hath put away thy
     sin, thou shalt not die. Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast
     given occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child
     that is born unto thee shall surely die." The divine justice
     punisheth every sin, either in this world or in the next. A
     sinner's willingness to undergo any punishment which shall be
     appointed by the minister of GOD, in order to make proof of, and to
     establish his repentance, is a sure sign that GOD has not withdrawn
     his grace, notwithstanding his sin.
