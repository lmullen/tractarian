                  HOLY DAYS OBSERVED IN THE ENGLISH CHURCH.

                                 [Number 56]
     __________________________________________________________________

     The Holy days observed by the Church of England are of two
     kinds:--Festivals, or days of joy: and fasts, or days of sorrow.

                        The FESTIVALS are:------

     THE NATIVITY OF OUR LORD, commonly called Christmas-day; on which we
     celebrate that great event, the birth, as man, of the everlasting
     and Almighty Son of God. (Dec. 25.)

     THE CIRCUMCISION OF CHRIST. On this day we are taught to remember
     with joy the transaction which may be called the first act of our
     LORD'S obedience to the law for our sakes; the beginning of
     that unspotted career of purity and duty, which He mercifully
     submitted to accomplish for the redemption of sinful man. (Jan. 1.)

     THE EPIPHANY, the manifestation, or making known of the new-born
     SAVIOUR to the Gentiles. The first individuals, from the nations who
     till then had walked in darkness, who bent the knee before Him, were
     the Wise Men of the East; when led by a miraculous star, they
     brought gold, frankincense, and myrrh, as their offerings to
     Bethlehem. And this event we, in an island which has since, by
     GOD'S mercy, also caught the bright rays of Christian truth,
     cannot too joyfully or too thankfully commemorate. (Jan. 6.)

     THE PRESENTATI0N OF CHRIST in the temple, commonly called, the
     PURIFICATION of St. Mary the Virgin. The event commemorated on this
     day is the fulfilment of prophecy (Malachi iii. 1.) by our
     LORD'S appearance in the Temple, whither He was brought that
     His mother might comply with the rite of purification, enjoined by
     Moses. The examples of the holy Simeon and Anna (Luke ii.) are on
     this occasion held up for our imitation. Like them we should
     devoutly rejoice that our earthly career has been blessed by the
     knowledge of CHRIST'S coming in the flesh;---that we have
     been enabled to see that light which was destined to lighten the
     Gentiles, as well as to be the glory of GOD'S people Israel.
     (Feb. 2.)

     THE ANNUNCIATION, or announcement of the approaching birth of the
     SAVIOUR by the angel Gabriel, to the Virgin Mary, Luke i. 26. (March
     25.)

     EASTER DAY, and the days following. On this greatest of all
     festivals, we celebrate the consummation of our LORD'S victory
     over the powers of darkness. His glorious and triumphant rising from
     the grave; an event in which His true followers rejoice as being
     alike the great confirmation of their Master's truth, and the
     earnest and proof of their own blissful resurrection in the fulness
     of GOD'S appointed time.

     Easter is kept on different days of the months of March or April, in
     different years, the time of its celebration depending on that of a
     full moon, as did the Jewish Passover.

     ASCENSION DAY, (forty days after Easter,) on which, as the name of
     the festival implies, we commemorate the ascension of our LORD into
     heaven, forty days after His resurrection.

     WHITSUNDAY, or the Feast of Pentecost, (ten days after Ascension
     day.) On this day we celebrate the fulfilment of our LORD'S
     parting promise in the descent of the HOLY GHOST, in fire, upon His
     Apostles, to abide with them, and with His Holy Church, even unto
     the end of the world.

     TRINITY SUNDAY, (the Sunday following Whitsunday.) On this day,
     having commemorated severally the different leading events in our
     LORD'S history, from the annunciation of His birth to the
     pouring forth of His Spirit, we are led by our Church to contemplate
     the mystery of our redemption in one general view; glorifying alike
     GOD the Father, who sent His dearly-beloved Son to save us; GOD the
     SON, who graciously undertook our redemption; and GOD the HOLY
     GHOST, who mercifully vouch safes to sanctify us, and all the elect
     people of GOD.

     THE CONVERSION OF ST. PAUL.........Jan. 25.

     ST. MATTHIAS ......................Feb. 24.

     ST. MARK ..........................Apr. 25.

     ST. PHILIP AND ST. JAMES ..........May 1.

     ST. BARNABAS ......................June 11.

     ST. STEPHEN .......................Dec. 26.

     ST. JOHN ..........................Dec. 27.

     On these days we are instructed to seek encouragement in our
     Christian warfare, by remembering, the triumphant issue of that
     warfare in the cases of those eminent followers of their LORD, the
     Apostles, the Evangelists, the Baptist, and the first martyr. In the
     graces bestowed upon them, we behold the most striking illustrations
     of GOD'S merciful promises of support to His servants; and in
     striving to confirm our own faith by the example of theirs, we are
     following the advice of one of themselves---of one "not a whit
     behind the chiefest of them,"---St. Paul. See his Epistle to the
     Hebrews, chap. xi.

     THE HOLY INNOCENTS. On this day we commemorate the infants of
     Bethlehem, whose blood, shed by Herod, was the first spilt by the
     enemies of Christianity in opposition to its progress. Mourning
     this, and all similar events, the Church yet directs our praises to
     Him, who made infants to glorify Him by their deaths; and who, while
     receiving to His mercy these and millions of other infant souls, has
     declared for the instruction of those more advanced in years, that
     "of such" as little children "is the kingdom of heaven." (Dec. 28.)

     ST. MICHAEL AND ALL ANGELS. Sept. 29.

     ALL SA1NTS. Nov. 1.

     We should ever recollect that we, humblest members of CHRIST'S
     Church militant here on earth, form part and portion of a great
     society---of what St. Paul calls "the general assembly and church
     of the first-born," Heb. xii. 23. And to this belong alike those
     glorious spirits who have never known either sin or sorrow, and
     those glorified saints, who, having come out of the great
     tribulations of earth, have washed their robes, and made them white
     in the blood of the Lamb, Rev. vii. 14. These two days are there
     fore set apart, that we may comfort ourselves, by thinking on the
     great privilege to which we are invited, of an union with that
     blessed society; and that the thought may inspire us with additional
     ardour to run, while yet on earth, the race that is set before us.

     The FASTS of the Church of England are,---

     In the first place, the vigils, or days before the following
     festivals.

     THE NATIVITY OF OUR LORD

     THE PURIFICATION

     TIIE ANNUNCIATION

     EASTER DAY

     ASCENSION DAY

     WHITSUNDAY

     ST. MATTHIAS

     ST. JOHN BAPTIST

     ST. PETER

     ST. JAMES

     ST. BARTHOLOMEW

     ST. MATTHIAS

     ST. SIMON AND St. JUDE

     ST. ANDREW

     ST. THOMAS

     ALL SAINTS.

     These the Church has prescribed to be observed as seasons of
     fasting, that we may bring our minds into a fitter state for
     celebrating the more joyful solemnities which succeed them. Those
     festivals which are not preceded by such fasts either follow
     immediately after festivals, or occur, for the most part, in what
     the Church considers seasons of joy; as, for instance, the
     Circumcision, at Christmas time, and St. Mark's day, between
     Easter and Whitsuntide, while we are commemorating the glorious
     events which followed the resurrection. With regard to the feasts of
     Saints and Apostles, the observation of these fasts tends to revive
     in our minds the recollection of the troubles and sufferings which
     these Christian heroes underwent on their way to the possession of
     that happiness and glory which we are, on their festivals invited to
     contemplate. And upon this principle, probably, it is, that no fast
     is appointed before the feast of St. Michael and all Angels. We have
     no previous struggles with sin or evil to commemorate in the history
     of those exalted beings who have never partaken of mortality or of
     its troubles; but have from the beginning, been happy, pure, and
     holy, in Heaven.

     LENT,---Or the season of forty days, excluding Sundays, which
     precedes Easter. The earlier part of this solemn season is in tended
     to prepare us for the great week of our LORD'S passion, with
     which it concludes. And the space of forty days seems marked out as
     a proper period for fasting and humiliation by the instances, not
     only of Moses and Elias, but of One far greater than they, who
     prepared Himself for the commencement of His ministry by a fast of
     forty days in the wilderness.

     ASH-WEDNESDAY.---The first day of those forty has ever been
     observed by the Church with peculiar solemnity. On that day, in
     early times, her ministers maintained the custom, which the Apostles
     had introduced and enjoined, of putting to open penance and shame
     notorious offenders against her laws or her authority; thus,
     according to the direction of Scripture, punishing them in this
     world, that they might be led to repentance, and that their souls
     might consequently be saved in the world which is to come.

     But those happier, because purer, days of the Church's history
     have past away. GOD in His own good time will renew them; and that
     He will speedily do so, we are bound to pray. In the meanwhile, the
     Church calls upon us, upon this day, collectively to humble
     ourselves before Him whom our sins and our abandonment of this godly
     discipline have deeply offended; and to implore His pardon for those
     transgressions, committed among us, without meeting such rebuke, for
     which we affirm with our own mouths, His vengeance and curse to be
     due. In making this acknowledgment, we continue, in the Christian
     Church, a ceremony which GOD Himself ordained for the Jews. See
     Deut. xxvii 13---26.

     The different days of Passion week: of the week, that is, between
     the Sunday before Easter and Easter-day are considered by the Church
     fasts of such importance as to have Epistles and Gospels appointed
     to each. The same reasons which should incline us to a reverential
     observance of Lent in general, apply of course, still more strongly
     to the week which represents the season of our SAVIOUR'S
     sufferings; and, most strongly of all, to that solemn day which
     commemorates His death; and which, in memory of the benefits which
     we derive from that mysterious event, we call Good Friday.

     That we may, indeed, keep in continual remembrance the exceeding
     love of our Master and only SAVIOUR, thus dying for us, the Church
     reckons among her other fasts,---

     All FRIDAYS in the year, excepting, of course, Christmas-day, should
     that festival fall on a Friday.

     The following days in the year are called EMBER-DAYS.

     The Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday after

     The first Sunday in Lent.

     The Feast of Pentecost.

     Sept. 14.

     Dec. 13.

     These days are ordained to be kept as fasts, because the four
     Sundays which respectively follow them are the appointed seasons for
     the ordination by our Bishops of priests and deacons to their sacred
     offices. St. Paul clearly declares the duty of all Christians to
     pray for those set in ministerial authority over them. And that
     fasting was practised by the early Church at the season when such
     ministers were ordained, we learn from Acts xiii. 3.

     The above, with the three days immediately before Ascension
     day,---days which, under the name of Rogation days, the Church
     has from the very earliest times employed in special supplication
     and prayer,---complete the number of the fasts of our English
     Calendar.

     A holy season which, though it is observed by some branches of the
     Church as a strict fast, is not comprised among the fasts of the
     Church of England, is that of ADVENT; the season of preparation for
     celebrating the festival of the Nativity. It begins on the fourth
     Sunday before Christmas, and continues till Christmas Eve.

     The Feast of the Annunciation
