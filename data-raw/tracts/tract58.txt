     Yet a little while, and the world seeth Me no more; but ye see Me.

     JOHN xiv. 19.

     MOSES endured his trials, according to St. Paul in the 11th chapter
     of Hebrews, "as seeing Him who is invisible. And this blessed
     privilege it is, according to the Apostle's language throughout
     the same chapter, which has distinguished the true servants of GOD,
     in every age, from the unbelieving world around them. Even while
     pilgrims here on earth, "the pure in heart," in one sense at least,
     "see GOD." They trace, alike in the events which befal themselves,
     and in the varying scenes which succeed each other before their eyes
     on the great theatre of life, a Presence and an Agency of which
     mankind at large know nothing. Things visible and tangible they feel
     but to be the screen and vail of the things invisible and intangible
     behind them; or, at most, to be the adjuncts and comparatively
     unimportant accompaniments of the great system in which their
     spirits really move. They view the things of earth as being, as in
     truth they are, necessarily connected with the things of heaven.
     They habitually look, not only" through nature, up to nature's
     GOD," but through the wide expanse of the social and moral world
     around them,---through the habits, opinions, and institutions, of
     their time and country---through the strife of politics, and the
     din of the unruly multitudes---to that eternal BEING who reigns
     above them all; whose will and whose counsels are in truth
     interwoven with them all,---and who works out His own great
     designs as surely by the operation of these jarring and unruly
     elements, as by the more tranquil and steady processes of the world
     of inanimate nature.

     And this view of GOD in all things---this habitual contemplation
     of the ALMIGHTY, His word, and will, in connection, not only with
     our daily actions, but even with the daily scene before us, it is,
     of course, the object of the great enemy of the Church to obstruct
     and to prevent. His most ardent wish is, to thicken the screen
     before us---to persuade us to regard the tangible things which
     surround us as the exclusive objects of our moral vision,---to
     induce in us a belief that the adjuncts to the great scene really
     open to our ken, are to be identified with that scene itself. And
     even with regard to things, which from their nature are the most
     essentially (so to say) connected with Heaven, he would have us
     forget the connection, and imagine that the things of earth with
     which, in this world, they are necessarily involved, are the
     heavenly things themselves. He would have the objects of our
     contemplation, and by consequence our spirits themselves, of the
     earth, earthy; he would darken the prospect before us by excluding,
     if possible, every gleam of celestial light which might burst
     through the vail; every ray of spiritual brightness which might
     impart to us, amid the dimness and the haziness of our nearer
     prospect, a conception of the glories of a world unseen.

     These great truths, for such they are, may be illustrated by
     examples varied as is the manner of Satan's warfare with the
     Church in each succeeding generation. But the most profitable
     illustration of them, as far as this generation is concerned, may be
     drawn from the mode in which he is especially labouring to deceive
     ourselves and our contemporaries by obscuring, as far as in him
     lies, from our view, the real nature of the Holy Church itself, to
     which we belong. That Church, we may presume, as contemplated by
     CHRIST'S followers, by the light which His Holy Spirit sheds
     upon their minds, is seen to be His own Divine Institution; to be an
     institution gifted and blessed by Himself in the first instance, and
     still presided over by Ministers deriving their authority from those
     Apostles on whom He deigned to breathe, and with whom, in their
     Apostolic capacity, He pledged Himself to be even unto the end of
     the world. They recognize in it a kingdom "not made with hands, not
     of this world," yet sent into this world, an illustrious guest, to
     bring to this world Salvation. They behold in it the glorious link
     which connects together, through every age and in every clime, the
     blessed company of all faithful people, the school in which the
     multitude whom no man can number, learn the song which they are
     hereafter, standing on the sea of glass, to sing before the Lamb
     which is in the midst of the throne on high. They reverence in
     it,---but on these subjects I dare not further enlarge,---the
     body of the Redeemer Himself, and His mystic Bride below.

     Such is, we may imagine, some faint outline of the view which would
     be taken of the Church by its true and approved members. With what
     reverence, then, must that Church, whether considered collectively
     or with reference to any given national branches of it---while,
     at least, such branches continue in their first faith---be by
     them regarded! And what a triumph must it be for the dark spirit of
     evil, when he succeeds in blotting from the mind of a baptized
     member of that Church every vestige of these exalting themes of
     contemplation; when he induces one entitled to rejoice in the
     blessed fellowship of the sons of GOD, to turn his eyes from these
     glories of his inheritance, and to fix them, exclusively, on the
     earthly accompaniments by which the Church, while here militant
     below, maintains her connection with the external world.

     But, alas! is he not doing this on every side around us? Is he not
     daily tempting ourselves to regard the Church, a true branch of the
     Church Catholic, established in these our islands, as a mere human
     institution? to consider the revenues with which the piety of holy
     men of old endowed its Ministers, as a provision set apart by the
     state for the purposes of education, with a view to the temporal
     advantage of society? and to imagine that those Ministers themselves
     are the servants of the government, appointed by its authority,
     primarily responsible to it for the discharge of their du ties, and
     subject (like civil or military officers appointed by the
     executive), alike with respect to the extent and to the duration of
     their powers, to its general superintendence and control.

     Such views are, in these days, notoriously too common; and a clearer
     instance cannot well be imagined of that system of forgetting things
     invisible in things visible, which it must be the most strenuous
     wish of the Power of evil to maintain.

     The Church, in itself, is a divine institution; and as a visible
     community and body in the state, it is also, in one sense, a
     political institution. The worldly speculator--he who limits his
     views to the tangible objects of sense,---will, therefore, regard
     it as a political institution alone. Its Ministers have spiritual
     powers, those, for instance, of administering the Sacraments; as
     possessors of property and privileges, they also, in this country,
     possess temporal powers. The worldly eye will therefore regard their
     temporal powers alone. As Ministers of CHRIST, they prepare man for
     a happy immortality in the next world, and in so doing, incidentally
     make him a better member of society, and improve his condition in
     this.---The latter effect of their teaching is all which strikes
     the worldly eye. As dispensers of religious knowledge, they
     incidentally promote the general education of mankind; and this
     latter comes to be considered by the world as their principal
     business. And lastly, while they derive their primary commission
     from the REDEEMER, and their secondary character---if I may so
     call it---from the constitution of the country, the eye of the
     world can see in them but the servants of the latter; forgetful that
     their true Master, that He to whom alone they are responsible for
     the discharge of the most important functions en trusted to them,
     the functions of their ministerial stewardship, is the Almighty Head
     of the Church who ever watches over it in Heaven.

     To entertain views like these, thus habitually to forget the
     connection which in truth exists between the ALMIGHTY and His own
     Holy Institution, is, in the most emphatic sense, to live without
     GOD in the world. And the line of conduct to which such views, if
     consistently acted upon, necessarily lead, cannot be contemplated by
     the serious mind without feelings of the most awful apprehension.
     The REDEEMER has told us that He is, in truth, ever about us; that
     He, even while seated in glory, feels, as though He were Himself the
     object of them, alike each act of kindness done to, and each injury
     inflicted upon, the humblest of His disciples. And if this be so, if
     the interests of individual members of His Church be in His view
     thus identified with His own, how intimately must He sympathize with
     the for tunes of that Church itself, of that Church which He deigned
     Himself to found, and especially to commend to our reverential care.
     Surely if we, blind to His gracious presence, presume to insult,
     despoil, or irreverently treat as a merely human thing His hallowed
     institution, we shall one day hear the voice once heard by Saul,
     "Why persecutest thou ME?" God grant that we may, like Saul, hear it
     while time yet lies before us; that we may hear it in the gentle
     accents of mercy, not in the trumpet-tone of judgment.

     Let worldly politicians and legislators, then, do as they list. Let
     them, if they imagine it will further their ambitious views,
     fearfully insult the Church established in our islands.
     CHRIST'S true servants, stedfastly refusing any countenance to
     their irreverent projects, will protest against them, if in no other
     way, by the quiet and consistent tenor of their lives. They will
     show the world by their actions that they behold the REDEEMER, as He
     has taught them to behold Him, in His Church. And if that Church,
     having long been an honoured guest in our Islands, is to be cast
     down from her high estate, and, whether in England or in Ireland, to
     be trampled under the foot of power, and made to give place to any
     one of the unauthorized sects which would usurp her place, they will
     continue to cling in her adversity to her who had been in her
     prosperity their nursing mother and their guide. Beholding her built
     upon the rock of apostolical authority, and convinced that she has
     not forfeited, by apostatizing from the faith, her original
     commission, they will reverence her Ministers as much when become
     the objects of the world's contempt, as they had reverenced
     them when that world bowed before them with pretended homage.

     The rulers of that world may suppose that the Church is in their
     hands; that they may deal with it according to their plea sure; and
     that its very existence is at their disposal. Thus thought the
     rulers of a former day, when the REDEEMER had given Himself into
     their hands, and when their agents exerted a last malice upon His
     lifeless remains. They knew it not that even then, in that dark
     hour, a limit was set to their presumption; the word of Heaven had
     passed that a bone of Him should not be broken, and the whole power
     of Heaven, could it have been necessary, would have interfered to
     prevent the violation of the decree. And thus, to our comfort let us
     remember, it must be with CHRIST'S body, the Church, even now.
     A limit has been set to its enemies which they cannot pass; the
     utmost extent of their successful malice has been fore-ordained,
     fore-registered, in Heaven; nor can they, even in its weakest hour,
     wreak one insult upon its apparently lifeless frame, beyond those of
     which GOD, in His goodness, sees fit to permit the infliction.

     The existence of such a limit it is impossible that they should
     believe, or even understand. Their views of the Church's for
     tunes and condition are necessarily as imperfect as their notions of
     the Church itself Seeing nothing but its tangible frame, conscious
     of its political existence alone, they naturally deem that the
     overthrow of these externals is the essential overthrow of the
     Church; which will, as they suppose, cease to exist at all when they
     shall have deprived it of all those symptoms of existence, which
     their faculties can perceive. They know not---the Church's
     enemies, till taught by fatal experience, never did know---that
     all which the utmost exertion of their violence can effect, will be
     but to bruise its heel. Its true, its inherent vitality, as it is
     beyond their ken, is also beyond their power; and in that vitality
     it may, if GOD SO please, grow and flourish the most, at the very
     moment of their fancied triumph in the supposed annihilation of its
     powers.

     Even to the Church's true members, its real glories here on
     earth, are for the most part the objects of Faith. "The kingdom of
     GOD cometh not with observation;" the workings of GOD'S Spirit
     in the assembly of His chosen,---His constantly repeated triumphs
     in the overthrow of evil, and in the increase of spiritual life
     among the faithful, are noiseless and unperceived. Churchmen know
     not, in their generation, what is passing around them, or even in
     themselves. In silence and in mystery, GOD is working out, now and
     continually, the accomplishment of those prophecies, the realization
     of those inspired pictures which describe the earthly glories of the
     MESSIAH'S kingdom. But the full comparison of those prophecies
     with their fulfilment, of those pictures with the original events
     from which, by Divine anticipation, they were drawn, will never
     perhaps be vouchsafed to mortal eyes. In a future state of being,
     when the ALMIGHTY'S ways shall be all at length made plain, it
     may be one of the happy employments of the Blessed to contemplate
     the Church as it was upon earth; to see how fully all that was
     predicted of it by the voice of inspiration was, throughout the
     period of its duration on earth, fulfilled, and how amply GOD
     redeemed the promises which He had made to His Holy Institution;
     manifesting in it, from generation to generation, His
     glory;---not indeed to sinners in the flesh,---but to the
     countless myriads who surround His throne,---to perfected Saints
     and unspotted angels,---and, in a word, to all the sinless and
     glorified Creation.

     In that retrospective view it will undoubtedly be seen, that the
     world, in systematically afflicting the Church, is but doing its
     appointed part. May the part assigned to ourselves be the happier
     one of witnesses for GOD'S truth and defenders of His Holy
     Institution. May we, seeing GOD in all things,---habitually
     contemplating the ALMIGHTY as now revealed to the eye of faith alike
     in His Church and in His world,---prepare ourselves, through His
     Grace, for that fuller and more perfect contemplation of Him, which
     shall hereafter be the privilege of the redeemed in Heaven.
