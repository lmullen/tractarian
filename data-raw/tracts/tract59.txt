                              CHURCH AND STATE.

                                 [Number 59]
     __________________________________________________________________

     WE are very naturally jealous of the attempts that are making to
     disunite, as it is called, Church and State; which in fact means
     neither more nor less, in the mouths of those who clamour for it,
     than a general confiscation of Church property, and a repeal of the
     few remaining laws which make the true Church the Church of England.

     This is what Dissenters mean by disuniting Church and State; and we
     are all naturally anxious to avert a step at once so unjust towards
     men and sacrilegious towards GOD.

     Let us not imagine, however, that every one who apparently joins
     with us in this anxiety must necessarily have the welfare of the
     Church at heart. Many people seem to join us at this crisis, and
     protest loudly in favour of the Union of Church and State, who
     nevertheless mean by this, something very different from what
     Dissenters mean, and from what we mean when we are opposing
     Dissenters. The "Union of Church and State," which many persons so
     call, and are so anxious to preserve, is in some points almost as
     great an evil, as it is confessedly, in other points, a good: and
     there are almost as many persons who support it for its bad points,
     as there are who hate it for its good.

     To make this plain, I shall endeavour to explain what it is that the
     Union of Church and State consists in, as now enforced by the law of
     the land.

     It consists in two things, STATE PROTECTION and STATE INTERFERENCE;
     the former of which, Dissenters wish to overthrow; and the latter of
     which, governments, of whatever kind, are very anxious to retain:
     while Churchmen have hitherto been contented to accept both
     conjointly, without perhaps very exactly calculating how little they
     gain on the one hand, and how much they sacrifice on the other. This
     subject is indeed one which, from the confidence hitherto placed by
     us in the integrity of government, has, perhaps, been much less
     investigated than any other of equal importance. But recent changes
     in the constitution have now so entirely altered the mutual
     relations of the Church and the Legislature, that what has in past
     times been a becoming, though perhaps misplaced, reliance on
     authority, would at present be a disgraceful negligence about our
     most sacred interests. In the following pages, then, it will be my
     object to consider the gains and losses which we accept jointly, in
     the Union of Church and State, arranging them under the
     above-mentioned heads: STATE PROTECTION and STATE INTERFERENCE.


     I. The PROTECTION which the Church receives from the STATE consists
     principally in four things. 1. In securing to us by Law some small
     portion of those ample endowments which the piety of our forefathers
     set apart for the maintenance of true religion in this country. Of
     these endowments far more than half are at this day in the hands of
     laymen, who may be of any religion or none, and do not consider
     themselves obliged to spend one farthing of it in the cause of GOD.
     But there is still a certain remnant in the hands of the clergy, who
     are there by enabled to spread truth over the land, in the poorest
     and most remote districts; and to live in decency themselves,
     without being a burden to the poor people for whose good they are
     labouring. This remnant then the State has forborne to confiscate,
     as it has confiscated the rest; and in this consists the first kind
     of State Protection.

     2. It further consists in enabling us to raise a tax on real
     property for the keeping our parish churches in tolerable and decent
     repair through the country,-which tax, as estimated by those who put
     it at the highest, amounts to about as many thousands a year as the
     other taxes amount to hundred thousands. This is the only existing
     law by which Englishmen, as such, are called on to assist in the
     maintenance of the Church of England.

     3. It consists, farther, in allowing Thirty Bishops to sit and vote
     in the House of Lords, to which House all Bishops, and many other
     Church Dignitaries belonged, as a matter of right, at the signing of
     Magna Charta; and from which they never can be excluded without
     violating the very first article of Magna Charta, the basis of
     English liberty.

     4. In the law De excommunicato capiendo, by which the State engages,
     that on receiving due notice of the excommunication of any given
     person, he shall be arrested, and put in prison until he is
     absolved.

     Such are the four principal heads of STATE PROTECTION: on reading
     them over, it will occur to every one, that the first is nothing
     more than common justice, and no greater favour than every person in
     the country receives in being protected from thieves; that, as to
     the second, the most that one can infer from it is, that in the eye
     of the State the importance of the Church is to the importance of
     civil government as a thousand to a hundred thousand, or as one to a
     hundred; that to counterbalance the third, which admits some Bishops
     to the House of Lords, all clergymen whatever are excluded from the
     House of Commons; and that the fourth is a bad useless law, which
     cannot be done away with too soon.


     II. Such is STATE PROTECTION: now, on the other hand, let us
     consider the existing set off against it, which is demanded of us.
     This is STATE INTERFERENCE, which encumbers us in ways too numerous
     to be catalogued, but is especially grievous in regard to the two
     following particulars:-1. Church Patronage. 2. Church Discipline.

     1. With regard to the first of these, it is obvious that the
     efficiency of the Church must ever mainly depend on the character of
     the Bishops and Clergy; and that any laws which facilitate the
     intrusion of unfit persons into such stations must be in the highest
     degree prejudicial, The appointment of our Bishops, and of those who
     are to undertake the cure of souls, is a trust on which so much
     depends, that it is difficult to be too cautious as to the hands in
     which it is placed and as to the checks with which its due execution
     is guarded. The sole object which should be kept in view is the
     getting these offices well filled, and the fewer private interests
     which are allowed to interfere in filling them the better. Yet what
     are the Laws which are forced on the acceptance of the Church for
     regulating this important matter? What is the care that has been
     taken to vest the appointment in proper hands? with what checks is
     its due execution guarded? what attention has been paid to any one
     point except the very last that should have been thought of, the
     private interests of patrons? We shall see.

     The appointment of all our Bishops, and, in much the greater number
     of instances, of those who are to undertake the cure of souls, is
     vested in the hands of individuals irresponsible and unpledged to
     any opinions or any conduct; laymen, good or bad, as it may happen,
     orthodox or heretic, faithful or infidel. The Bishops, every one of
     them, are, as a matter of fact, appointed by the Prime Minister for
     the time being, who, since the repeal of the Test Act, may be an
     avowed Socinian, or even Atheist. A very large proportion of other
     Church benefices, carrying with them cure of souls, are likewise in
     the hands of the Prime Minister, or of the Lord Chancellor and other
     Lay Patrons, who, like him, may be of any or no religion. So much
     for the hands in which these appointments are vested: the checks by
     which they are guarded must be considered separately in case of
     Bishopricks and of inferior benefices.

     At former periods of our history, even in the most arbitrary and
     tyrannical times, various precautions were adopted to prevent the
     intrusion of improper persons into Bishopricks. To exclude the great
     officers of state from a share in the nomination was indeed
     impossible-perhaps not desirable-but to prevent their usurping an
     undue and exclusive influence, their choice was subjected to the
     approbation of other bodies of men, with different interests, and
     sufficiently independent to make their approbation more than a form.

     The Nomination of the King and his Ministers was to be followed by a
     real bona fide election on the part of the Collegiate Body attached
     to the vacant See. In the Church of Canterbury this body consisted
     of 140 men, with small incomes, and connected, in many instances,
     with the peasantry of the country, whose feelings and opinions they
     seem to have, in a great measure, represented. The courage and
     resolution with which these men frequently resisted state
     persecution, will be appreciated on reading Gervase's History
     of Canterbury, between the years 1160 and 1200. Indeed, it would be
     no difficult matter to make a catalogue of the atrocities
     perpetrated at different times on these collegiate bodies by kings
     and nobles, in the hope of extorting consent to improper
     nominations; such as would rival Fox's Book of Martyrs in
     number and cruelty. Here then was the first check on improper
     appointments.

     Again, after Nomination and Election followed Confirmation, a
     process well calculated to elicit any sinister dealings which might
     have influenced the previous steps. On a day appointed by the
     Archbishop, all persons whatever that had any objection to urge
     against the Election or person elected, were cited to appear in the
     cathedral church of the vacant Diocese. The Archbishop was himself
     to be in attendance as judge, to confirm or annul what had passed,
     according to the evidence which should come before him. The
     publicity of this process, and the circumstance that it was
     conducted in a place of all others the most interested in the
     result, seemed calculated to preclude any very flagrant neglect of
     duty.

     But, should no obstacle have interfered with the will of the State,
     either in Election or Confirmation, it still remained with the
     Archbishop to decide whether he was justified in consecrating: and
     in deciding this he was left to the dictates of his own con science,
     exposed indeed to the vindictive tyranny of power, but uncontrolled
     by any law, and responsible to no earthly tribunal.

     Thus it appears that in the most arbitrary and tyrannical times the
     constitution of England recognised three independent checks to the
     King's appointment, allowing a veto to be put upon it either at
     Election, Confirmation, or Consecration. These checks were, indeed,
     frequently overpowered by the capricious tyranny of the feudal
     system, or the still more capricious interference of the Bishop of
     Rome. Perhaps, also, though upon the whole well adapted to the times
     in which they were devised, they are unsuited to those in which we
     live. Yet it is evident, that what ever difference exists between
     those times and our own, it is a difference in our favour; whatever
     checks to abuse of power could exist then, might exist, and more
     effectually, now; nor can any objection we may make against the
     particular checks adopted under the feudal system, be an argument
     for abolishing them without finding a substitute.

     The object of these remarks is not to raise impatience and
     complaint, or to suggest changes in present arrangements, which,
     except under certain contingencies, it might be wrong to
     contemplate, but merely to set before the Church its position. I
     have shown what it was in the middle ages, in order to assist our
     minds in the inquiry; let us, with the same object, now advance to
     the consideration of its present condition.

     It cannot be denied that at present it is treated far more
     arbitrarily, and is more completely at the mercy of the chance
     government of the day, than ever our forefathers were under the
     worst tyranny of the worst times. Election, Confirmation,
     Consecration, instead of being rendered more efficient checks than
     formerly, are now so arranged as to offer the least possible
     hindrance to the most exceptionable appointments of a godless
     ministry. As to Election: the Dean and Chapter, with whom it still
     formally rests, have only twelve days given them to inquire into the
     character of the person nominated, who may be an entire stranger to
     every one of them, or known through report most unfavourably; if
     they fail to elect in this time, election becomes unnecessary, and
     the Crown presents without it. And now the Dean and Chapter have
     eight days given them, and the Archbishop twenty, for reflection; if
     within these periods the former fails to go through the form of
     election, send the latter to consecrate, both parties subject
     themselves to the pains and penalties of a Praemunire, i. e. all
     their goods, ecclesiastical and personal, are liable to
     confiscation, and themselves to imprisonment till such time as they
     submit. Such is the legal urgency which has been substituted for the
     violence of former times: and thus, as the law now exists, we have
     actually no check on the appointments of a Socinian (if it so
     happen) or Infidel Minister, guided by the more violent influences
     of a legislative body, for which I feel too much respect as a
     political power, to express an opinion about certain portions of its
     members.

     Again, with regard to the inferior patronage of the Church: a large
     proportion of our benefices are, as has been already noticed, in the
     hands of laymen, who may be of any religion under heaven; and the
     laws of England (it must be confessed with sorrow) watch so
     jealously over the interests of these patrons, and so little over
     those of the Church, that they compel the Bishops, except in cases
     so outrageous that they can hardly ever occur, to accept at once of
     the person first presented to them, and to commit the cure of souls
     to him by the process of institution. It is worth observing what
     Judge Blackstone says upon this subject. "Upon the first delay,"
     says he, "or refusal of the Bishop to admit the Clerk, the Patron
     usually brings his writ of Quare impedit against the Bishop for the
     temporal injury done to his property in disturbing him in his
     presentation.... The writ of Quare impedit commands the Bishop to
     permit the plaintiff to present; and unless he does so, then that he
     appear in Court to show his reason." What sort of reason the Court
     will be satisfied with, the Judge informs us in another place. "
     With regard to faith and morals," says he, "if the Bishop alleges
     only in generals that he is schismaticus inveteratus, or objects a
     fault that is malum prohibitum merely, as haunting taverns, playing
     at unlawful games, or the like, it is not good cause of refusal."
     The Judge proceeds, "if the cause be some particular heresy alleged,
     the fact, if denied, shall be determined by a jury." The sum of the
     whole is, then, that unless the Bishop can prove to the satisfaction
     of a jury in a Court of Common Law, that the person presented to him
     for institution has been guilty of some particular immoral act above
     the grade of malum prohibitum, or has maintained some opinion such
     as shall come under thc strict definition of heresy, he loses his
     cause, and then, if he persist in his refusal, is liable to an
     action for damages, in which the Judge informs us "the patron may
     recover ample satisfaction."

     Now, if any one were to search among his own acquaintances for those
     whom he considers least fit for clergymen, he would certainly find
     that his reason for thinking so was of a kind which he could not
     make good before a court of justice. Those who wish to see this
     matter in its true light should read over 1 Tim. iii. to verse 10.,
     and then reflect whether St. Paul would have been very likely to
     approve of the law of England as it now stands.

     These are among the effects of STATE INTERFERENCE, as it affects
     Church Patronage. As to Church Discipline, without entering into the
     reasons for restoring it, it may be sufficient to mention one fact,
     showing the practical effect of the law to suppress it.

     Every Churchwarden in every parish in England is called on once a
     year to attend the visitation of his Archdeacon. At this time oaths
     are tendered to him respecting his different duties, and among other
     things he swears, that he will present to the Archdeacon the names
     of all such inhabitants of his parish as are leading notoriously
     immoral lives. This oath is regularly taken once a year by every
     Churchwarden in every parish in England; yet I believe such a thing
     as any single presentation for notoriously immoral conduct has
     scarcely been heard of for a century. So that it would certainly
     seem that, if within this last century any notoriously immoral man
     has been residing in any parish in England, the Churchwardens of
     that parish have been perjured: and this is the effect of certain
     laws, which we should call persecuting, did they not exist in our
     own free country, which interfere with the due discharge of their
     solemn engagement.

     These remarks are offered to my brethren without immediate practical
     object. Circumstances, however, may occur any day which would make
     them immediately practical; and it is necessary to be prepared for
     these. Firmly as we may be resolved at present, from the dictates of
     a sober and contented spirit, not to commence changes; yet when
     changes are commenced, and seem likely to extend still more widely,
     it may obviously be the duty of Churchmen, in mere self-defence, to
     expose and protest against their destitute and oppressed condition.
