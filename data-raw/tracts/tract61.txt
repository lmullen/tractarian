          THE CATHOLIC CHURCH A WITNESS AGAINST REAL ILLIBERALITY.

                                 [Number 61]
     __________________________________________________________________

     ILLIBERALITY of mind in religious matters, bigotry, intolerance, and
     the like, is the disposition to make unimportant points important,
     to make them terms of communion, watchwords of parties, and so on.

     Now the Church Catholic acts on the principle of insisting on no
     points but such as are of importance, of judging of opinions
     variously according to their respective importance, of acknowledging
     no parties, and of protesting and witnessing against all party
     spirit and party dogmas.

     One remarkable instance of this is to be found in the circumstance,
     true as a general rule, and capable of explanation in its apparent
     exceptions, that it knows no master but CHRIST, as He enjoined. It
     struck the attention of Christians as early as the age of
     Athanasius, what is witnessed at this day, that heresies bear the
     name of individual teachers, whereas the Catholic Faith has no
     especial human interpreter, but is transmitted on from CHRIST
     through His Apostles, in every place. Considering, how the names of
     the champions of all opinions are circulated to and fro by all
     parties, it is a very surprising fact, that those only remain at
     this day inseparably connected with the respective doctrines of
     those who bore them, which belonged to heretics: e g. in spite of
     all the efforts that have been made, to call the orthodox faith
     Athanasian, that word occurs, for the most part, only in a
     transitory page of history, being exchanged for Catholic by the
     upholders of the faith, Trinitarian even by its enemies, who,
     meanwhile, cannot help connecting themselves as Arians, Sabellians,
     Nestorians, &c. with human masters. In like manner, modern history
     opens upon us Lutherans, Calvinists, Brownists, Wesleyans, &c., but
     would be perplexed what title to give to the English Church less
     respectful than Episcopalian. We have plainly no human master, such
     as, Melanchthon, Bucer, or Cranmer, whatever influence these
     celebrated individuals might have in their day. We are a branch of
     the Church Catholic. Not that the absence of such human title is a
     criterion of Gospel truth; for there were Gnostics of old, and
     Independents and Quakers now; but that the Catholic doctrine is ever
     free from this badge of intolerable bondage.

     This is shown in the case of the parties within the Church, as well
     as of the heresies and sects external to it; e. g. the Augustinians,
     the Jansenists, or the Arminians among ourselves; or in the various
     monastic orders, as Benedictine, Dominican, and the like. I mean,
     the tolerance and comprehensiveness of the Church is shown from the
     fact, that she can afford to receive within her pale varieties of
     opinion, imposing on its members, not agreement in minor matters,
     but a charitable forbearance and mutual sympathy. Hence she has been
     accustomed to distinguish between Catholic Verities and Theological
     Opinions, the essentials and non-essentials of Christian Faith.

     In doing this, she has been guided by the text, spoken against the
     Pharisees, "Judge not, that ye be not judged;" and while enforcing
     this command, she both exemplifies obedience to it in her own case,
     and also becomes herself a test, applied to the hearts of men, to
     ascertain whether they are bigoted and narrow minded or not.
     Contrast the text just quoted with 2 John 10, 11. "If any man come
     unto you, and bring not this doctrine," &c. and you see at once her
     gentleness and her severity.

     Herein lies one eminent argument in favour of the divine origin of
     the Church, that, by the course it has actually taken, it gives us a
     clue to reconcile "not judging," with "not bidding God-speed."

     Again, the claim of authority with which it silences quarrels,
     affords, I say, a test, such as we antecedently might expect would
     be given us, for ascertaining that latent Pharisaical temper of
     party which our LORD rebukes.

     Submission to Church authority is the test whether or not we prefer
     unity, and the edification of CHRIST'S body, to private
     fancies.

     Thus, e. g. when the man of strong feelings, in old time, merely
     founded a college or monastery for devotion and study, he satisfied
     the test. When, in modern times, he opens a conventicle, and forms a
     sect, he is condemned by it, as Pharisaical.

     When the Baptists go so far as to separate, because they think
     children ought not to be baptized, they fail under the application
     of it, since the Church, though earnestly enjoining infant baptism,
     does not exclude from communion those who scruple at it; therefore
     the Baptists are self-banished. When the Non-conformists separated
     on account of the surplice, the cross in baptism, &c. they too were
     detected and convicted of a rebellious spirit, by the same test.

     The spirit of Schism, in addition to its other inherent characters
     of sin, implies the desire of establishing minor points as Catholic
     or essential points, or the spirit of exclusiveness.

     The desire of novelty is restlessness; the maintenance of our own
     novelty is selfishness.

     Zeal is the effort to maintain all the Truth; party spirit is a
     perverse maintenance of this or that tenet, even though true, yet to
     the suppression and exclusion of every thing else. "Forte hinc
     appellata Catholica," says Augustine, "quod totum veraciter teneat,
     cujus veritatis nonnullae particulae etiam in diversis inveniuntur
     haeresibus."

     While Dissenters are exclusive on the one hand, Papists are so on
     the other. The Council of Trent converted certain theological
     opinions into (what they maintained to be) Catholic Verities. This
     was wrong, whoever did it; but it is some comfort to find, that the
     body that thus became uncatholic, was not the Church Catholic
     itself. It had been wretched, indeed, had the Church, in its
     Oecumenic or Universal capacity, surrendered its own essential
     character, and added to the Catholic faith private judgments. But
     the Tridentine Council was a meeting of but a part of Christendom.
     Though the Latin communion is given at 80,000,000 souls, yet the
     Greek Churches are said to comprehend as many as 50,000,000, and
     these were not there represented. Where too were the Bishops of the
     Reformed Churches? Catholic doctrines are those to which the whole
     Catholic Church bears witness: the Council of Trent was collected
     only from parts of the Church, such parts as differed from the views
     ultimately adopted there being excluded; and, therefore,
     representing but a part, not the whole of the Universal Church, it
     assumed a privilege not belonging to it; for none but the Catholic
     Church can attest Catholic Truths. As to our Thirty-nine Articles,
     they were never imposed as essential, only as a basis of union in a
     particular Church.

     It may be added, that, while the Catholic Church is a stay to the
     inquiring Christian, she is a check upon the forward. She recommends
     much to us, which she does not impose, like a true loving mother,
     "giving her judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the LORD to
     be faithful." All that is necessary for enjoying the privileges
     committed to her, is belief in the Apostles' Creed, and that
     teachable spirit that does not introduce novelties upon it; but in
     her Articles and Liturgy she aims at directing into the truth, in
     all its parts, such as wish "to follow on to know the LORD."
