                              CHURCH DISCIPLINE.

                                 (Continued.)

     Heb. xiii. 4. "Whoremongers and adulterers GOD will judge." You dare
     not say that this is not true. What can you say to your own mind to
     make it easy? Nothing but this can make you easy:---to take shame
     to yourself, to confess your sins, to fast, and to pray earnestly to
     GOD for pardon, &c., and to let others know "what an evil thing and
     bitter it is to forsake the LORD."

     This visitation will either do you much good or much hurt; you will
     from this time grow much better or much worse.---Since you did
     not blush to sin, do not blush to own your faults. Let it be matter
     of joy and thankfulness to you, that we are concerned for you so
     much. Grace indeed we cannot give,---that is the gift of
     GOD;---we can only pray for you, and do our duty in admonishing
     you, &c.---If you submit for fear only, and not for conscience
     sake, you will suffer both here and hereafter.

     When men, and especially men in any authority, are not content to
     neglect their own salvation, but are industrious to ruin others,
     they may depend upon it, they are very near filling up the measure
     of their iniquities, and consequently their destruction is not far
     off.

     Our charity to offenders ought to be like that of GOD, not in
     flattering them by a cruel indulgence, but in putting them, by a
     merciful severity, in the way of obtaining pardon.

     In the primitive Church, no great offenders were restored to
     communion till they had, by their behaviour, given all possible
     demonstrations of the sincerity of their "repentance, not to be
     repented of;" and this, by a long trial of mortification, &c.; for a
     short repentance too seldom ends in amendment of life; and he who
     fancies that his mind may effectually be changed in a short time,
     will deceive himself and the Church, unless he shows this change by
     fasting, almsdeeds, retirement, &c., and that for a considerable
     time.

     Will any man say that he loves CHRIST and his Church, when he
     opposes the authority of her pastors; when he opposes her
     discipline; or when he weakens her unity?

     When we consider, that GOD is absolute master of men's hearts, we
     should not think any man incapable of salvation.

     MY GOD! let me always fear for myself, when I am labouring to
     promote the salvation of others.

     Remissness in Church discipline is owing, sometimes to indulgence
     and an easy temper, not caring to trouble others, or to be troubled;
     sometimes by being satisfied to go on in the track trodden by their
     predecessors, not considering what duty obliges them to, but what
     was done before. Others, out of downright neglect, not caring how
     things go, give opportunity to the enemy to sow tares while they are
     thus asleep. Thus corruption gets head, and is like to do so, until
     GOD awakens the Governors, both in Church and State, and makes them
     see, that they are answerable for all the sins occasioned by their
     negligence; and that they have more souls, besides their own, to
     account for; which is one day to fall heavy upon them. LORD, awaken
     all that are in power, and me, thy unworthy servant, that we may all
     discharge our duty more faithfully.

     There may be people bold enough to make a mock of sin, to submit to
     public penance with contempt of the authority that enjoins it, and
     not to be bettered by such Christian methods for the restoring
     sinners to the peace of GOD; but it is to be hoped all are not so
     hardened, and that Christian discipline is, notwithstanding, a
     mighty check upon sin, and keeps many under a fear of committing
     such crimes as must oblige them to take shame to themselves before
     the face of men.

     Convocation, 1536.---"That perfect penance which CHRIST requireth
     consists of contrition, confession, and amendment of former life,
     and an obedient reconciliation to the laws and will of
     GOD."---See also the Homilies.

                                  Absolution
     .

     Our Church ascribeth not the power of remission of sins to any but
     to GOD only. She holds that faith and repentance are the necessary
     conditions of receiving this blessing. And she asserts what is most
     true, that CHRIST'S ministers have a special commission, which other
     believers have not, authoritatively to declare this absolution for
     the comfort of true penitents; and which absolution, if duly
     dispensed, will have -a real effect from the promise of CHRIST.
     (John xx. 23.)---Pull. Moderat.

     Authority of the Church
     is only spiritual and ministerial (the Head and authority being in
     heaven). She does not, therefore, call her orders Laws, but Rules,
     Canons; and her inflictions, not punishments, but censures. She
     acknowledges that whatever power she has besides spiritual, is
     either from the favour or injunction of princes.

     But (Article 37.) we give not our princes (and they have always
     disclaimed it) the power of administering GOD'S Word, or the
     Sacraments. And although our spiritual power be from GOD, yet is
     this power subject to be inhibited, limited, regulated, in the
     outward exercises, by the laws and customs of the land. By this
     moderation both powers are preserved entire and distinct. We neither
     claim a power of jurisdiction over the prince, nor pretend to be
     exempt from his.

                           Antenuptial Fornication
     .

     Those who enter into marriage only to conceal their shame, ought to
     give public satisfaction, as well as expiate their sin, by open
     penance.

     The greatest care ought to be taken concerning the sincerity of
     penitents; till that be done, penance will only be a form without a
     power or any real benefit.

     In the primitive Church, every thing was done with advice, because
     their great aim was to have reason and the will of GOD prevail. A
     despotic power was forbid by CHRIST himself: "It shall not be so
     among you." He that is humble and charitable will take the mildest
     and surest way, and will not be troubled, provided the end be
     obtained.

                                   Penance
     .

     Sin is the disease of the soul. Diseases are not to be cured in a
     moment: it will take time to root out their causes, and to prevent
     their effects; so will is require time to prove the sincerity of our
     resolutions. We solemnly profess that we repent, and we are not sure
     but that we lie to GOD.

                                  Discipline
     .

     As discipline slackened, men's manners grew more and more corrupt,
     even in the primitive times. There were never more infidels
     converted (saith Fleury) than when catechumens were most strictly
     examined, and baptized Christians put to open penance for their
     sins. They that are for making still more concessions to human
     frailty, will at last set aside the Christian religion, which is
     established upon maxims of eternal truth, and not on human policy;
     and instead of gaining or securing the bad, they will lose the
     better sort. A flattering physician is for giving palliating
     medicines, to ease the pain, without taking away the cause, which
     will occasion relapses, until at last they destroy the patient. But
     a good man will prescribe what he believes necessary to remove the
     cause, though uneasy to his patient, and will have nothing to do
     with such as will not submit to the necessary methods of cure.

     Penances, in the primitive Church, were never granted but unto such
     as desired them, and such as desired to be converted. None were
     forced, but such as would not submit were excommunicated.

                           Discipline impracticable
     .

     This cannot be, when it was practised for so many years in the
     primitive: Church. And what if it be one of those things which
     CHRIST has commanded His followers to observe so strictly, Matt.
     xxviii. 19, 20; and which He had learned of the FATHER, John xv. 15.
     and xvi. 13. The commands of Christ cannot be impracticable. That
     would be to tax Him with ignorance or weakness. When He promised to
     be with his Church to the end of the world, He engaged to give such
     graces as were necessary to raise us above our natural weaknesses.

     Penances forced are seldom lasting. The Priest, under the Law, could
     not accept the offering of a leper, nor allow him to partake of the
     sacrifice, till he had received convincing tokens of his cleanness;
     no more ought the Christian Priest to treat sinners as cured, till
     he sees the proof. Quesn.

     Matt. xvi. 19. "Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
     in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shalt be loosed
     in heaven."

     Those ministers that know not what it is to bind and loose sinners,
     reject one half of their commission.

     Excommunication is the last remedy reserved for the incorrigible in
     the case of enormous sins. They who despise it, know not what it is
     to be an heathen in GOD'S sight,---to be without GOD for a
     Father, CHRIST for a Saviour, the Church for a Mother, and
     Christians for brethren.

     A true penitent is always willing to bear the shame and confusion of
     his sin and folly before men, that he may escape the anger of GOD.

     Heb. xii. 15. "Looking diligently, lest any more fail of the grace
     of GOD; lest any root of bitterness springing up, trouble you, and
     thereby many be defiled. Lest there be any fornicator, or profane
     person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright;"
     that is, such as for a short pleasure forfeit their eternal
     inheritance.

     Happy that sinner, whom GOD does not abandon to the hardness of his
     heart, but awakens him by his judgments, or the visitations of his
     grace.

     Luke viii. 28. "I beseech thee torment me not." These were the words
     of the Devil to our Lord, and these are the suggestions in the
     hearts of all sinners, wherever he has got possession. When a
     minister of CHRIST, by his sermons, rebukes, &c., or the Church, by
     her disciplines, attempts to disturb the sinner, they are looked
     upon as his mortal enemy; and they treat both the Church and her
     Ministers worse than this legion did JESUS CHRIST. They despise
     their power, set at nought their persons, and threaten and persecute
     them for their good will. Vide Quesn.

     There is not any greater or more dreadful sign of the wrath of GOD,
     than when he abandons a sinner to his lusts, and permits him to find
     means of satisfying them.

     The public good is the sole end of Church discipline. The interest
     of the governors of the Church is no way concerned in it; but only
     the advantage of their flock, that sinners may be converted; that
     contagion may be hindered from spreading; that every one may be kept
     to his duty, and in obedience to the laws of GOD; that judgments may
     be averted from the public, and that GOD in all things may be
     glorified; that differences among neighbours may be made up, and
     charity improved, &c.

     Discipline (saith our Homily of the right use of the Church, Part
     II.) in the primitive Church was practised, not only upon mean
     persons, but upon the rich, the noble, and the mighty; and such as
     St. Paul saith, were even given to Satan for a time.

     Those that make a mock, a sport, a jest of sin, too plainly betray a
     love of wickedness in themselves.

                                  Exemption
     .

     A legal exemption cannot free a man from guilt, beyond the extent of
     that power which grants the exemption. If it be a human power, it
     can extend no farther than to exempt a man from human penalties, not
     from those that are purely spiritual.

     Eccles. viii. 5. "Reproach not a man that turneth from sin."

     They whom fear renders cowardly in the exercise of their ministry,
     forget that they act in the name and place of Christ, and are to
     account to him for the mischief the Church receives thereby.

     Deut. i. 17. "Ye shall not be afraid of the face of men, for the
     judgment is GOD'S."

     O righteous Judge of the world, give me and my substitutes grace,
     patiently to hear, and impartially to weigh, every cause that shall
     come before us in judgment.

     Give us a spirit to discern, and courage to execute, true judgment,
     that all our sentences may be approved by thee, our LORD and Judge.
     Amen.

     Deut. xxiv. 17. "Thou shalt not pervert the Judgment of the
     stranger, nor of the fatherless."

     Isaiah i. 23. "Every one loveth gifts: they judge not the
     fatherless; that is, they are poor, and cannot bribe them."

     Exod. xxiii. 2, 3. "Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil;
     neither shalt thou speak in a cause, to decline after many, to wrest
     judgment: neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause."

     Deut. xix. 15. "Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor
     honour the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou
     judge thy neighbour."

     The judgment of the multitude is no rule of justice. "Then cried
     they all, Not this man, but Barabbas."

     John xix. 12. "If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's
     friend;---when Pilate heard that saying," then he resolved to
     sacrifice his conscience, rather than lose his prince's favour.

     2 Chron. xix. 6. "And he said to the judges, take heed what ye do:
     for ye judge not for man but for the LORD, who is with you in the
     judgment."

     Prov. xvii. 13. "He that justifieth the wicked, and he that
     condemneth the just, even they both are an abomination unto the
     LORD.

     John xix. 11. "Except it were given thee from above." Although the
     magistrate's authority is from GOD, yet he is answerable to GOD for
     the due execution of it.

     Prov. xxi. 3. "To do justice and judgment is more acceptable unto
     the LORD than sacrifice."

     Isaiah i. 11. "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices
     unto me? saith the Lord: I am full of the burnt-offering of rams,
     and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of
     bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats."

     Hosea vi. 6. "For I desired mercy and not sacrifice; and the
     knowledge of GOD, more than burnt-offerings.''

     Micah vi. 7, 8. "Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or
     with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for
     my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He
     hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord
     require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk
     humbly with thy GOD."

     The Jews had a rule that if a rich man and a poor man had a
     controversy, they must both of them stand or sit, to avoid
     partiality.

     Virtue would hardly be distinguished from a kind of sensuality, if
     there were no labour---no opposition---no difficulty in doing
     our duty. Dulce est periculum sequi Deum.

     The duty of a judge may oblige him to punish according to the law;
     but it is the part of a Christian injured to forgive according to
     the charity of the Gospel.

     A judge is not the master but the minister of the law---for the
     public good, not for his own interest, passion, or will.

     A good judge will never desire to make himself feared by his power;
     but will rather be afraid of abusing it.

     The civil magistrate is liable to be excluded from Church communion
     for such reasons as the spiritual governors shall judge
     necessary;---they are to determine for him, and not he for them,
     in matters merely spiritual.

     Give me, O LORD, the spirit of judgment, (Isaiah xxviii. 6.) that I
     may govern this Church with wisdom.

     Eccles. iv. 9. "Be not faint-hearted when thou sittest in judgment."

     A lover of the law will always have an eye to the intent of the law.
     (Matt. xii. 3.)
