                    BISHOP BULL ON THE ANCIENT LITURGIES.

                          (From his XIIIth Sermon.)

                                 [Number 64]
     __________________________________________________________________

     [To Timothy,] to this public person, to this great bishop of the
     Church, is this charge given by St. Paul, in my text: "I exhort,
     therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers,
     intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men," &c. He
     was to take care that such prayers should be made in all churches
     and congregations under his inspection and jurisdiction.

     And how could he do this, but by providing by his authority that
     there should be set forms of prayer, framed according to this rule,
     given him by the Apostle, to be used in those churches? Sure I am,
     the primitive Catholic Church understood this to be the meaning of
     the Apostle. Hence, in all the churches of CHRIST over the world,
     however distant from each other, we find set forms of public
     prayers, suited and conforming to this direction of the Apostle.

     And, indeed, if we consult all the ancient liturgies extant at this
     day, we shall find this observation to be most true; they are all
     framed and composed according to this rule of the Apostle.

     And it is observable, that however those ancient liturgies have been
     altered and corrupted in after times by many additions and
     interpolations, yet there are in all of them still remaining many
     excellent and divine forms of prayer and thanksgiving, wherein they
     do all perfectly agree, and which, therefore, can not reasonably be
     thought to have any other original than apostolical order and
     appointment, delivered to the several nations and people, together
     with the first preaching and planting of Christianity among them.

     Such, for example, is the Sursum corda in the Office of the
     Communion, the Priest saying, "Lift up your hearts;" and the people
     answering, "We lift them up unto the Lord." There is no Liturgy in
     any church of CHRIST to this day but hath this form.

     Such is the excellent form of Thanksgiving, in the same Office of
     the Communion, to be performed by the Priest and people; the Priest
     saying, "Let us give thanks unto our Lord God;" and the people
     answering, "It is meet and right so to do." This form also is to be
     found in all the most ancient Liturgies.

     Such also is the Doxology, or glorification of the ever-blessed
     Trinity: " Glory be to the Father," &c.

     I add to what hath been already observed, the consent of all the
     Christian churches in the world, however distant from each other, in
     the prayer of Oblation of the Christian Sacrifice in the Holy
     Eucharist, or Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; which consent is
     indeed wonderful. All the ancient liturgies agree in this Form of
     Prayer almost in the same words, but fully and exactly in the same
     sense, order, and method; which whosoever attentively considers,
     must be convinced that this order of prayer was delivered to the
     several churches in the very first plantation and settlement of
     them. Nay, it is observable, that this Form of Prayer is still
     retained in the very Canon of the Mass, at this day used in the
     Church of Rome, though the Form doth manifestly contradict and
     overthrow some of the principal articles of their new faith. For
     from this very form of prayer, still extant in their Canon, a man
     may effectually refute those two main doctrines of their Church, the
     doctrine of Purgatory, and that of Transubstantiation.... Thus, by a
     singular providence of GOD, that ancient, primitive, and apostolic
     Form of Prayer still remains in the Liturgy of that Church, as a
     convincing testimony against her latter innovations and corruptions
     of the Christian doctrine. But this by the way.

     The same harmony and consent of the ancient liturgies (i. e.
     services) is to be found in the office of Baptism, where the person
     to be baptized is obliged first to "renounce the Devil and all his
     works, the pomp and vanity of the world," &c., and then to profess
     his faith in the Holy Trinity, "God the Father, Son, and Holy
     Ghost." This Form is to be found in the liturgies of all the
     churches of CHRIST throughout the world, almost in the very same
     words, and is therefore doubtless of primitive and apostolical
     origin.....

     Other instances of the like nature I could give you, if the time
     would permit. But these I think are sufficient to show that there
     were set, prescribed Offices and Forms of Prayer and praise, and
     professions of faith, delivered to all the Churches of CHRIST by the
     Apostles or their immediate successors; many of those Forms
     (notwithstanding the manifold corruptions and depravations of the
     primitive Liturgies in after times) being still retained, and
     unanimously used in all the Churches of CHRIST to this day.

     The following account of the Thanksgiving in the Holy Eucharist,
     mentioned by Bishop Bull in the above extract, is from Bingham,
     Antiq. xv. 3.

     "As soon as the Common Prayers were ended, and they had saluted one
     another with a kiss, bread, and wine and water were brought to the
     President; who receiving them, gave praise and glory to the FATHER
     of all things by the SON and HOLY SPIRIT, and made a long
     thanksgiving for the blessings which he vouchsafed to bestow upon
     them. And when he had ended the prayers and thanksgiving, all the
     people that were present, answered with acclamation, Amen".

     After the same manner Irenaeus, "We offer unto Him His own gifts,
     thereby declaring the communication and truth of both flesh and
     spirit. For as the bread, which is of the earth, after the
     invocation of GOD upon it, is no longer common bread, but the
     Eucharist, consisting of two parts, the one earthly, the other
     heavenly: so all our bodies, receiving the Eucharist, are no longer
     corruptible, whilst they live in hopes of a resurrection. But we
     offer these things to Him, not as if He stood in need of them, but
     as giving Him thanks for His gifts, and sanctifying the creature."

     So Origen says, "They eat the bread that was offered to the Creator,
     with prayer and thanksgiving for the gifts that He had bestowed on
     them...."

     Cyril of Jerusalem more particularly specifies the substance of this
     thanksgiving in his Mystical Catechisms, saying, "After this we make
     mention of the heaven, and earth, and sea, &c...." This is much the
     same with the thanksgiving in St. James's Liturgy, which was
     used in the Church of Jerusalem, in this form: "It is very meet and
     right, becoming us and our duty, that we should praise Thee, and
     celebrate Thee with hymns, and give thanks unto Thee, the Maker of
     all creatures, visible and invisible, the Treasure of all good, the
     Fountain of life and immortality, the GOD and LORD of all things,
     whom the Heavens, and the Heaven of Heavens praise, and all the host
     of them; the sun and moon and the whole company of stars; the earth,
     the sea, and all that are in them; the celestial congregation of
     Jerusalem; the Church of the first born, who are written in heaven;
     the spirits of just men and prophets, the souls of martyrs and
     apostles; angels and archangels, thrones and dominions,
     principalities and powers, the tremendous hosts, and cherubims with
     many eyes, and seraphims with six wings, with two whereof they cover
     their faces, and with two their feet, and with two they fly, crying
     out incessantly one to another, and singing with loud voices the
     triumphant song of the magnificence of Thy Glory, Holy, Holy, Holy,
     Lord of Hosts, heaven and earth are full of Thy Glory, Hosannah in
     the Highest. Blessed be He that cometh in the name of the LORD.
     Hosannah in the Highest."
