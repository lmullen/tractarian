                         SUPPLEMENT TO TRACT XVIII.

     ON THE BENEFITS OF THE SYSTEM OF FASTING PRESCRIBED BY OUR CHURCH.

                                 [Number 66]
     __________________________________________________________________

     THE following observations were occasioned by some questions, signed
     "Clericus," addressed to the Editor of the British Magazine, in
     April last; as they related to my tract, I felt called upon to
     answer them as far as I could; and they are now re-printed, with
     some additions, in the hope that they may remove some difficulties,
     which stand in the way of returning to the wise Rules of our Church,
     with respect to the Christian duty of Fasting.

     E. B. P.

     OXFORD.

     The Feast of St. James
     .
       _______________________________________________________________

     I. Wednesday Fast. I did not mean to imply that this was a fast of
     our church. In p. 6, I meant to speak of the example set us by the
     early church; in p. 10, "the two-sevenths of the year, which the
     church has wished to be in some way separated by acts of self-denial
     and humiliation," include the forty days of Lent, not the Wednesday.
     Undoubtedly many pious Christians have an especial respect for the
     Wednesday, as the day on which our SAVIOUR is supposed to have been
     betrayed, and also because their church has, in consequence,
     hallowed it by the use of the Litany. It would be natural for any
     Christian, who would add occasional private fasts, to select the
     Wednesday: and this it were well to bear in mind, for the church
     prescribes what is generally necessary only; those who strive at
     higher degrees of holiness, and are constantly stretching forward,
     will, when accustomed to them, practise it themselves in private
     acts of self-denial at other times.

     II. Does a feast ordinarily supersede a fast, or how is the fast to
     be engrafted upon the feast? Our church, in that she has made one
     exception, (viz. that her weekly Friday fast is to give way to the
     birth-day of her Lord,) and one only, seems to me to imply, that on
     all other occasions the fast is to be retained. Yet this does not
     supersede the feast. The glad remembrance on each such feast-day
     still remains,---whether that GOD then crowned with exceeding
     glory the labours and patience of His blessed servants, the
     Apostles, or whether it were some act of mercy conveyed to us
     directly in His SON. The act of fasting (when the habit is acquired)
     chastens, but diminishes not our joy; nay, on the festivals of the
     blessed Apostles, it carries on the lesson of the vigil, and teaches
     us how we must "enter into His rest." This, then, seems to me to
     answer the third question, Are the vigils to be kept as fasts, in
     such cases, as well as the day itself? I should answer, yes; because
     the vigil, or fast, of the preceding evening, is intended to prepare
     the soul, by previous abstinence and meditation, that it may rise
     disposed, and refreshed, and unencumbered, ready to receive GOD'S
     holy influences on the morrow, and this ground is even increased by
     the additional solemnity of that morrow. There appears, however, to
     be this difference between the vigil and the Friday, or the Lent
     fast, ---that in the vigil, not humiliation, but preparation for
     a solemn service, is the main object, the fasting is incidental
     only; as indeed the very name leads one to think of the watching and
     previous meditation, not of the abstinence, except as far as it
     facilitates this end.

     IV. Rogation days; or, the three days preceding our Lord's
     ascension. This, according to Bingham, is a Western fast, unknown in
     the East, where the whole period of Pentecost was one season of joy.
     This fast appears to have been a sort of extended vigil, preparatory
     to the day "when the Bridegroom was taken away," and teaching us
     that, laying aside our worldly appetites, we should "in heart and
     mind thither ascend, and with Him continually dwell." "Doubtless,"
     says Caesarius, bishop of Arles, "he loves the wounds of his sins,
     who does not, during these three days, seek for himself spiritual
     medicines, by fasting, prayer, and psalmody." The council of
     Orleans, A. D. 511, ordained that they should be kept after the
     manner of Lent. There is something salutary both in the eastern and
     the western view; in most periods, however, of church history, the
     earnestness and distrust of self implied by this preparation for the
     festival of the Ascension is more fitted and more salutary for us
     than the unbroken exulting joyousness of the eastern church.

     V. Should the observance of the church's fasts be public? and
     if so, how should it be regulated? Undoubtedly we are not to fast,
     any more than to pray, or give alms, "to be seen of men:" but as no
     one has ever interpreted our SAVIOUR'S warning as forbidding public
     or Common Prayer, so neither can it apply to public or common
     fasting. If we do publicly only what the church requires, there is
     no more boastfulness in so doing than in going publicly to church.
     "In the season of the Passion," says Tertullian, "when the religious
     observance of fasting is universal and in a manner public, we
     scruple not to lay aside the kiss of charity, (this omission was the
     public avowal that a person was fasting,) not caring to conceal an
     observance which all are sharing with us." But further, since
     fasting is to be accompanied by retirement, al1 that the world need
     know is, that we do fast; the degree of self-denial need be, for the
     most part, known only to GOD, or to those immediately in one's
     domestic circle, who, it may be hoped, will share our feelings and
     our practice, and with whom there is no parade. We are not to
     obtrude our practice on others, but neither (as Clericus well
     objects) dare we deny it, if discovered, any more than we should
     deny that we were walking to church, although it should be on some
     holy day which the world has disused. Nay, this very denial proceeds
     (in part, doubtless, from misinterpretation of our SAVIOUR'S
     precept, but in part also) from some sort of feeling that it is a
     great thing which we are doing. On the other hand, let a person
     familiarize his mind to the idea that fasting is but a "plain duty,
     (obedience to the church,)" and he will feel, that to try to mislead
     persons as to his performance of that duty must needs be wrong,
     because it is deceitful, but is also wrong, as countenancing evil,
     and the neglect of duty. It is, undoubtedly, often very painful to
     speak of, or to avow, any of one's own religious practices,
     especially when asked in an irreverent spirit, ---it seems like
     profaning the sanctuary of one's own heart; ---yet there is in
     most minds that instinctive respect for a man's honest conviction,
     as well as for the simple straight-forwardness, which, when called
     upon, would cheerfully state the truth, that any unaffected avowal
     that we thought it our duty to fast, would instantly command
     respect---often perhaps lead to inquiry. Only, we must beware
     that we be not inconsistent or forward: a person who should
     voluntarily go into a mixed or large society, where the very object
     of meeting was relaxation or amusement, and yet purpose to fast
     there, would deservedly expose himself to the charge of
     inconsistency, because he has chosen for his fast a place manifestly
     unsuited to it, and he must bear the difficulties which he has
     brought upon himself. On the contrary, should it be convenient to
     his Diocesan, or Archdeacon, to hold a visitation on one of the
     church's fasts, (the case proposed by "Clericus,") there would be
     nothing in the intercourse of a visitation dinner inconsistent with
     the abstemiousness of a fast-day. Generally speaking, however,
     retirement and self-collection seem so essential a part of fasting,
     that, unless on some extraordinary occasion, which might give a
     decidedly religious character to the meeting, I should think it best
     for any one, who would observe the church's fasts, to abstain from
     all society, except that of his own circle. The Fellows of one of
     the most respected Colleges in this place have, for years, made it a
     rule neither to accept nor to give any dinner-invitations on the
     Wednesdays and Fridays in Lent. This has been a good beginning, and
     they have been the more respected for making this rule, even by
     those persons who have not thought it needful to follow their
     example. Some other persons, though probably but few, have extended
     their rule to all the fast-days of the church, except on some
     extraordinary occasions, such as those above hinted, or where
     respect to persons in authority seemed to supersede their private
     judgment; on such occasions, they would practise a quiet
     unostentatious abstemiousness. Nor do I think that any charge of
     singularity (in any obnoxious sense) does or would attach in any
     case when a person acts simply and unostentatiously. If a clergyman,
     e. g., were, in declining the invitation of an elder minister, to
     assign as his ground, that he did not dine out on fast-days, there
     would be something unbecoming in this sort of tacit reproof to an
     older labourer in GOD'S vineyard; but though we must not disguise
     the truth, if asked for, we need not voluntarily put for ward the
     grounds of our actions; we might leave it to circumstances to lay
     them open, as far as might be necessary; and if we make no parade of
     our practice, our Christian liberty will be respected. But, should
     it be otherwise we are, of course, not to count that "some strange
     thing has happened unto us," though our good should be evil spoken
     of. After all our precautions against ostentatiousness, censure of
     others, and the like, our very practice, if accounted of any moment,
     will probably be regarded as implying blame of those who allow
     themselves in the things from which we think it our duty to abstain;
     especially shall we have much difficulty in the first outset, but
     from within, more than from without. We all, probably, magnify our
     own importance, and think that our neighbours canvass us more than
     they do; whereas some passing observation? that "we are good sort of
     people, but have exaggerated notions about the church's authority;"
     or that "our state of health or spirits leads us to excited notions
     about fasting," or that "we have new-fangled notions about Christian
     antiquity," or, perchance, that "we are half papists in this, though
     sound in other respects," and the like, and so we are dismissed.
     Meanwhile, with a little patience, and a few years, (if GOD allots
     them to us,) our new-fangled notions will have become old; it will
     be seen, that in proportion as we love the old Catholic
     Christianity, we must hate the modern corruptions of it in popery;
     and, if we do not influence those older than ourselves, which we
     should not even expect to do, since it is not natural, and we on the
     contrary shall constantly have to learn something of almost all our
     elders,) we sha1l, in our turn, gradually become older, and shall be
     able to influence those whom GOD in His ordinary dealings intends
     that we should influence---our younger brethren; and that, too,
     when we shall not only be convinced, on the authority of the church,
     and of older Christians, that regular prescribed fasting is good,
     but have known it for ourselves, and shown it forth, by GOD'S grace,
     in our lives.

     VI. In what is the abstinence of fasting to consist? On this
     question I can say no more than I have already said. Persons,
     constitutions, occupations, states of health, habits of mind, vary
     so indefinitely, that I do not see how a rule, which must take all
     these into account, can be general. I do not indeed think it a
     sufficient answer, which some urge, that fasting, e. g., sours their
     temper, &c. &c., for it remains to be proved, whether, if under
     taken, not as an experiment, but as a duty, not as an isolated act,
     but as a habit, it would have that effect. Undoubtedly the flesh
     will rebel at first, as it does against every attempt made to subdue
     it, but this does not prove that it would not be tranquil and weaned
     at last. Again, the habit of fasting would naturally be accompanied
     by some degree of corresponding change in our other habits, which
     might tend to make it lighter; as of old when men, e. g., on
     fast-days, abstained from all unnecessary exercise or fatigue, which
     might incapacitate the soul from performing its duties aright,
     unless the body had its usual refreshment. And some such
     arrangement, I should think, parochial ministers, even with
     extensive cures, might make, allotting to the fast-day such portion
     of their weekly duty as was least exhausting. Yet, after all, one
     rule will not apply to all, young or old, in strong health or
     weakly, engaged in active or in sedentary duties, of full or spare
     habits; as again, some of the ends of fasting will vary according to
     the periods of life, habits, or temperaments; and, with the ends, so
     will the modes also, or degree of fasting. "As fasting hath divers
     ends," says Bishop Taylor, speaking of private fasting, "so has it
     divers laws." And for the temptation peculiar to youth, he remarks,
     "a sudden, sharp, and violent fast" will often only aggravate the
     evil. What is then needed is, "a state of fasting, a diet of
     fasting, a daily lessening our meat and drink, and a choosing such a
     course of diet as may make the least preparation for the lusts of
     the body." This, although belonging directly to private fasts, is so
     far to our purpose, as indicative of his judgment, that the rules of
     fasting must be adapted to our several cases; and it was with this
     view, that, in the second edition of my tract, I alluded (p. 23) to
     the [xerophagia], the less rigid fast of the ancient church, in
     hopes that those who, from ill health, were unequal to the harder
     fasts, might yet not think themselves excluded from the privilege of
     fasting. And if the fast serve no other purpose than to distinguish
     the day from ordinary days, by "eating no pleasant bread," yet even
     this degree of fasting, where no other is admissible, can be, and
     has been, blessed by GOD. The rules which I would recommend to one
     commencing the observance of the church's fasts would be: ---1.
     To abstain, as far as possible, from all mixed society at meals on
     those days, both as likely to be inconsistent with the frame of
     mind, which it is the object of the fast to cherish, and as tempting
     us (were it but to escape notice) to break our rule. 2. Not to tie
     himself down to any severe rule at first, as to the degree of
     fasting; for as our bodies have been inured to ease, so must they
     gradually be inured to seasonable austerities, If we lay down too
     strict a rule, it may, in reality, be too much for us at first, and
     so we may be tempted to lay aside the whole habit; whereas, had we
     begun more modestly, we might in time have arrived, with comparative
     ease, at the higher measures of it. 3. To watch carefully the
     effects upon our own minds of any failures or inconsistencies in our
     practice; for these failures carefully observed, when we have once
     begun the practice of fasting, will show its real uses, more,
     perhaps, than the direct benefits of the practise itself. 4.
     Accompany the fast not only with increased prayer and meditation,
     but with other little outward acts of self-denial, for thus the
     whole day will be more in keeping, and the mind taken off from
     dwelling too much on the one act of fasting. Thus the brunt of our
     enemy's attack will not rest upon this one point, (as is likely to
     be the case if the fasting stand alone,) but, by being divided, will
     be weakened. "A man," says Bishop Taylor, "when he mourns in his
     fast, must not be merry in his sport; weep at dinner, and laugh all
     day after; have a silence in his kitchen, and music in his chamber;
     judge the stomach, and feast the other senses." So again Bishop
     Taylor instances "hard lodging, uneasy garments, laborious postures
     of prayer, journeys on foot, sufferance of cold, paring away the use
     of ordinary solaces, denying every pleasant appetite, rejecting the
     most pleasant morsels, as being in the rank of bodily exercises,'
     which, though, as St. Paul says, of themselves they 'profit little,'
     yet they accustom us to acts of self-denial in inferior instances,
     and are not useless to the designs of mortifying carnal and sensual
     lusts." A person would never have selected these instances without
     having tried them himself, and found their use; and, on the other
     hand, most persons probably, who have systematically tried fasting,
     have experienced the benefits of some of these accessories. Some of
     these also may be irksome at first, as others would be to many no
     self-denial at all; but every one knows what, however trifling,
     would be self-denial to him, and the frequent repetition of these
     acts is a constant, though gentle, self-discipline. It seems to me
     part of the foolish wisdom of the day, and its ignorance of our
     nature, to despise these 'small things,' and to disguise its
     impatience of restraint under some such general maxim as, that "God
     has no pleasure in self-torture, or mortification," ---"God wills
     to see his creatures happy," and the like: undoubtedly GOD wills not
     our death, but our life; not our misery, but our peace; but GOD
     often restores our bodily health by bitter herbs, the knife or
     cautery, and why not our spiritual? Our forefathers knw better, and
     by disciplining themselves in these little things, attained to
     greater; they knew that religion is concerned about little things,
     as well as great; that if we look to great occasions or great
     instances only, we shall form no habit; and therefore they shrunk
     not from mentioning all the little instances, if they were only (the
     case of an aged and pious relative of my own, long since with the
     Lord,) abstinence from snuff during Lent, or abridging
     self-indulgence as to morning sleep, which they had found useful to
     them. 5. Take especial care to practise self-denial as to food at
     other times also, lest the fast degenerate into a mere opus
     operatum, a thing good in and for itself, even if followed by acts
     of an opposite kind. In Bishop Taylor's words, "Let not intemperance
     (or self-indulgence) be the prologue or the epilogue to your fast.
     When the fast is done, eat temperately according to the proportion
     of other meals, lest gluttony keep either of the gates of
     abstinence." The importance of this caution will probably be felt by
     those who have tried to fast; or it may be seen in the corruptions
     of the Romish Church. 6. Let young ministers, or those who hope to
     be ordained to the ministry, beware lest they be lef, by the novelty
     of this duty, to overvalue it, or to undervalue those who have lived
     in time when it was not systematically practised. Obedience to a
     parent is a higher duty than fasting: "GOD will have mercy, and not
     sacrifice." If, therefore, a parent object to any particular mode of
     fasting, let it be laid aside for the time, and let the individual
     exercise himself in self-denial in this also; that he relinquishes
     what a parent objects to, while he looks out for himself other modes
     to which his parent would not object. 7. Omit trying no act of
     self-denial in little things, which without your own thought,
     suggest themselves to you, merely because they are little; such
     suggestions are generally proved by the result not to have come from
     ourselves, and if followed, they lead onward. 8. If one mode of
     fasting do not suit your health, then, after a time, try another;
     some persons who could not bear early abstinence, (the loss of a
     breakfast,) might well endure sub sequent privation, such as eating
     a sparing meal early, as the last in the day, or hley might at least
     decidedly abridge their principal meal, or, again they might be able
     to strike off all luxury in their food. 9. Supposing all these
     attempts to fail, after having been fairly tried, yet a person might
     keep up the spirit of fasting, by such accessories as those
     instanced, (No. 4,) and might multiply these in proportion as he is
     obliged to abandon the other, that so he may be ready to avail
     himself of his ability to fast, whenever GOD shall restore it to
     him. A person of weak health is constantly tempted to
     self-indulgence in matters which do not concern his health, e. g.
     indolent postures, taking food at the first moment of craving, &c.
     &c.; and thus he may exercise real self-discipline, even if
     physicians pronounce him incapable of fasting without impairing his
     ability to do his duty where GOD has placed him. Let any one
     consider what is the boast of our country---our comforts; and he
     will see what a tendency these have to make him forget his heavenly
     country, and that he is but a pilgrim,---to make him think it
     "good for him to be here." How much may be abridge, and yet, by his
     self-denial, only not be more disadvantageously situated than
     others. Or, to take another view, does not this show us how many
     occasions of self discipline we are furnished with more than our
     neighbours, from our very national character and circumstances, and
     that a person need be at no loss for instances of self-government if
     he but look for them? 10. If a person acquire the habit, let him
     recollect how slowly he arrived at the conviction of its necessity,
     and not be surprised that others are as slow, or appear yet more so;
     perhaps, without fasting, they are more self-denying than one's self
     with it. "Let it be done," says Bishop Taylor, "just as a man takes
     physic, of which no man hath reason to be proud, and no man thinks
     it necessary but because he is in sickness, or in danger and
     disposition to it." 11. Especially let any one re collect how much,
     which is humiliating in his youth, (even if GOD saved him from open
     sin,) might have been prevented by the habit of fasting, if he had
     then practised it; let him bear this in mind, when he fasts, and
     make his fast an act of humiliation for his own particular sins, as
     well as a discipline, so can he never be proud of his fasting.

     I will only add, that fasting has by no means so many difficulties
     as Satan would persuade men, for fear they should try it. Even among
     the poorer, some act of self-denial as to the pleasures of sense
     might easily be practised, (1 Cor. vii. 5, might be hinted at;) and
     to instance one case only:---A poor woman mentioned, with much
     respect, her father's practice never to taste food before receiving
     the Lord's Supper; (adhering unconsciously to the practice of the
     universal Church in its better days, and indeed of our own in Bishop
     Taylor's time;) she added, "I never heard that his bodily health
     suffered from it." With regard to the rich, (who are obviously
     called upon to fast in greater degrees,) I have the authority of an
     eminent physician, whom I well know not to be wedded to any
     particular theory of medicine, that in ninety-nine cases out of a
     hundred, the degree of fasting recommended in my tract would not
     only not be injurious, but be beneficial. He added, "Fasting is like
     the Sabbath---healthy to the body as well as to the soul."

     VII. Is there any difference between abstinence and fasting? Not, I
     imagine, in our Church, although she retained the terms which were
     used to denote different degrees of abstinence in the Romish; and
     this I infer from her nowhere saying which are days of fasting, and
     which of abstinence, whereas the Romish Church does distinguish
     them; further, as Wheatley remarks, they are called in the second
     title (where they are enumerated), "days of fasting or abstinence."
     As in other cases, our Church seems to have used both terms, in
     order to show that she therein comprehended, without distinction,
     all to which these several names had been given.

     VIII. Vigils. There appears to have been no difference between the
     regulations of these and other fasting-days. Whether the old vigil
     was formally abolished is uncertain: (Card. Bona de Divina Psalmod.
     c. 4. ÃY. 3, contends that vigils were regulated only, and not
     abolished, except in a provincial Spanish Synod; they were
     prohibited also in the Council of Cognac, A. D. 1260.) Yet it fell
     into desuetude, and then the name was transferred to the fast of the
     preceding day; which fast probably existed before the vigil was
     disused. " Since the saints," says Alcuin "arrived at their present
     happiness through temporal affliction, we, as we rejoice together
     with them in their eternal joy, so must we needs suffer with them,
     that following their steps throughout, we may ......arrive at the
     same joys. To mark this, on the days preceding those of their birth
     (into the other life), which days we call their vigils, eating more
     sparingly than usual, we devoutly preface those solemnities with the
     due observance of fasts, and with affliction of the flesh; that,
     purified by the abstinence of the preceding day, we may the more
     worthily celebrate the joy of the following festival." Fasting,
     then, seems to have been a primary part of the solemnity, ---to
     remind Christians, namely in their namely in their days of ease, how
     " through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of GOD,"
     and that the "good soldiers of CHRIST must endure
     hardness,"---not merely as a preparation for the duties-of the
     morrow. Each day had its peculiar subject of meditation and of
     resolve; the vigil, ---the hardships which the Apostles endured
     in their conflict; the festival---the Christian graces which
     through this their patient perseverance they realized, and the glory
     bestowed upon them. Yet even as a mere preparation, the Christian
     also might do well to remember (blessed are they who know it not)
     that corpus onustum---animam quoque praegravat una, atque affigit
     humi divinae particulam aurae.

     IX. "Clericus" asks, in connexion with this subject, what is to be
     done, where there is no daily service, as to the prayers appointed
     for the Ember-week to be used every day? I own,, the more I hear or
     think of this subject, or those connected with it, I am the more
     convinced that the clergy are wrong in withholding daily prayers,
     that they underrate the willingness or the wish of their people to
     go to Church, if invited. To mention two or three facts only:
     ---In a small country village of less than 300, where a clergyman
     was assured that he would have a congregation on Saints'-days, there
     assembled in winter, (when there was not much work) to prayers only,
     above fifty persons. In another, where there was service on the
     Wednesday and Friday in the Ember-week, with a sermon, the
     congregation was like that of a Sunday, and the people deeply
     interested. In a manufacturing town, on the eves of Saints'-days,
     with a sermon, it averaged 1000. A poor person here told a friend of
     my own incidentally, that her father, when he had no work, went
     round to see where there was any service. Surely we are neglecting
     to supply the cravings which either already exist, or might readily
     be awakened, when man has no earthly friend. And might not our poor,
     when destitute of employment, be led to the Church instead of to the
     ale house? Consider, again, how different would the state of things
     be, if every Church in our country had but its ten, or eighteen, or
     fifty worshippers. Would not the holy angels rejoice at such a
     sight? and might not the evils we dread, per chance, by GOD'S mercy,
     be averted? Again, how would such simple prayer undermine the
     world's present maxim, which would make human agency, and so
     preaching, every thing! How would it, too, build up those who are
     real Christians, and so raise the standard of Christianity among us!
     or how would it support, and comfort, and purify, and initiate into
     the happiness of their coming life, many who arc about to part from
     this! To return to the Ember-days, besides the direct, incalculable
     blessing which would result from their observation, do not they
     furnish an opportunity of inculcating, what in these days is much
     needed, the claims, the importance, the sanctity of the office of
     the Christian ministry and of the Church, without the appearance of
     extolling one's self or one's office because it is one's own?

       _______________________________________________________________

     P.S. Some space being left, it may not be amiss to say a few words
     on some of the prevailing prejudices against fasting. There is no
     explicit command to fast in the New Testament. Persons are but
     little aware how far this argument will go. Any one will find, if he
     examine, still less proof that he should receive the Communion of
     his Lord's Body and Blood, still less direct proof that he shall go
     to Church on the Lord's day, that he may have his infant children
     ingrafted into Christ, that there is any especial object in morning
     and evening prayer, that he should read the Scriptures daily, and in
     fact for almost every practice, which every person who cares about
     his soul, knows to be needful for him. I omit others, because some
     might be glad of an excuse for abandoning them also. Now what is the
     direction about the Lord's Supper? Our Saviour says, " This do, as
     oft as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me." And of fasting He
     says, "When ye fast, be not as the hypocrites:" in both cases, it is
     implied that the observance shall be followed, and in both,
     directions are given concerning how it is to be observed: in the one
     case, "not as the hypocrites," in the other, "in remembrance of ME."
     I do not mean that there is not satisfactory proof, that Christ has
     given His body and blood to be our spiritual food and sustenance, or
     not full and condemning evidence, by way of inference, that whoso
     does not "eat the flesh of Christ and drink His blood," in His
     Supper, "has no life in Him;" but the objection made against the
     necessity of fasting is drawn from the absence of any explicit
     direction to fast habitually; let men observe then, that on the same
     ground they should doubt whether they should habitually receive the
     Lord's Supper. Nay, the direct evidence is perhaps the stronger in
     behalf of fasting: for in answer to the objection " The disciples of
     John fast oft, but thine eat and drink:" our Saviour replies, "when
     the Bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then shall they fast
     in those days." (Luke v. 34, 35.) Does not this then imply that the
     only difference between John's disciples and our Saviour's in this
     respect, was, that the Apostles had their Saviour still in the body,
     present with them; but that afterwards they should fast as John's
     disciples did? and when we find that they did so fast, what farther
     commentary on our Saviour's words do we want? and if we fast not,
     are we acting, as He said His disciples would? or if we make a
     spiritual fast, why do we not adopt spiritual sacraments, i. e. none
     at all? If, again, we have indications of frequent communions in the
     New Testament, so have we of "fastings often:" if we trace up the
     practice of the early Church in the sacramcnts to the inspired
     writings, and so obtain the sanction of GOD'S word for the early
     practice, why not in the use of fasting, which is equally clear ?
     why not, except that the one is an obvious privilege and costs us
     nothing, while fasting, though a privilege, is at first painful, and
     so we shut our eyes and refuse to see?

     "Fasting," we are told, "is a legal observance, which may be useful
     at a certain stage of religious progress, for an infantine state in
     individuals or in the church; but is unfit for an advanced state,
     such (it is implied) as we are in." It is remarkable that the same
     persons, who at one time objected to fasting, as not resting on a
     positive law, should next complain of it as legal. It might suffice
     to answer, Why then did our Saviour fast? or, rather, (for we dare
     not speculate on things too high for us,) since it was part of His
     Father's will that He should fast, must it not be needful for us?
     and may not one object of His fasting have been to leave an example
     to us, (as nothing, which He did, can be without its meaning to us,)
     and just to shew us that fasting is a spiritual action, and belongs
     also to a high spiritual state? For His fasting was not required to
     fulfil the law, since fasting formed no part of the law, and was
     engrafted upon it by the prophets, or spiritual men among the Jews,
     as a part of self discipline, and so was an evangelical portion of
     the old dispensation. And, as matter of history, who, among
     Christians, have fasted most rigidly? Uniformly, the most spiritual;
     and they, increasingly, as they went on heavenwards.

     And to what else can one attribute it, that so many eminent men in
     the French Church, amid all the disadvantages of a corrupt religion,
     attainded a degree of spirituality rare among our selves.

     "Fasting is Popish." If this means, that it has been preserved amid
     the errors of Romanism, is not this true of most of the truths of
     the Gospel? Our charge against the Romanists, generally, is not that
     they have not preserved the truth, but that, like the Pharisees,
     "they have made it of none effect by their traditions;" at least, in
     great measure, to so many of their members. And does not the
     objection imply that we have forgotten the peculiar character of our
     church, which is not a mere Protestant, but a Primitive Church? And
     if we are to prevail in our approaching conflict with Romanism, or
     to be (as we seem marked out to be) a means of reclaiming that
     Church, must we not reconsider the character of our own Church, and
     take our stand in its principles, not in the protestantism of other
     churches, or of the day?
