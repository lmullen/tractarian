          ON THE MYSTICISM ATTRIBUTED TO THE FATHERS OF THE CHURCH

          Â§i- Occasion, Grounds, and Limits of the Present Inquiry

     (1.) It is curious, and may not be uninstructive, to observe how
     from time to time the assailants of Primitive Antiquity have shifted
     their ground, since the beginning of the seventeenth century. During
     the struggle of the Reformation, men had felt instinctively, if they
     did not clearly see, that the Fathers were against them, so far as
     they had begun to rationalize, whether in ecclesiastical practice,
     or in theological inquiry. But it was many years before they
     ventured to avow this feeling distinctively to themselves, much more
     to maintain and propagate it. It was not until divines of this class
     had thoroughly wearied themselves in vain endeavours to reconcile
     the three first centuries with Calvin and Zuinglius, that DaillÃ©
     published its celebrated treatise Of the Right Use of the Fathers^1:
     in which under the pretence of impugning their sufficiency as judges
     between Papist and Protestant, he has dexterously insinuated every
     topic most likely to impair their general credit; professing all the
     while extreme respect for their sanctity and their wisdom; although
     perhaps an attentive reader may perceive his ironical meaning,
     disclosing itself more and more, as his argument draws to a point.
     However, by his skill in rhetorical arrangement, and by a certain
     air of thorough command of his subject, which he has been very
     successful in assuming, he became at once the standard author for
     all who took that side of the question: opening (if so homely a
     simile may be allowed) a kind of cheap shop, to which all who had a
     fancy for wares of that kind have ever since found it convenient to
     resort.

     But though at the bottom DaillÃ© seems to have had no more respect
     for Antiquity than those who came after him, he differs from them
     greatly, not only in his tone and manner, but also in the very
     ground and substance of his argument: professing, first, to confine
     himself to those points which are disputed between the Reformed and
     the Roman Church, (and, therefore, not to except against the
     Fathers' evidence on matters debated in their times, e. g. on
     the Trinitarian controversy) and, secondly, laying, or seeming to
     lay, the chief stress of his objections on the scantiness of their
     remains, the amount of corruption and interpolation, the difficulty
     of ascertaining their real sense and the like. When he does proceed
     to challenge their authority, he is careful in pointing out their
     own disclaimers of such authority, before be exemplifies their
     supposed errors and inconsistencies ; which be does largely, but
     with great show of unwillingness, in the concluding sections of his
     work.

     But now, if we pass over a hundred years, and come to the attacks
     made on the Fathers in the beginning of the eighteenth century, we
     shall find, for the most part, the same quotations appealed to, the
     same particulars insisted on, but with an air of much more open
     defiance, and with the direct and avowed purpose of impugning their
     credit, not in this or that point only, but in all questions of
     Christian religion. Thus Whitby prefaces his collection of what be
     calls specimens of patristical exposition of Scripture, with a
     declaration^2, that be wishes to exclude appeals to Antiquity, as to
     the transmission of the Rule of Faith, (meaning the great
     fundamental doctrines,) no less than in facts of general history, or
     in the controversies between England and Rome. And Middleton, in his
     flippant "Free Inquiry," lays the stress of his argument on his
     being able to prove that the ancient Fathers "were of a character
     from which nothing could be expected but what a weak or crafty
     understanding could supply, towards confirming those prejudices with
     which they happened to be possessed, especially where religion was
     the subject".^3

     One would think it impossible to go, beyond this in the way of
     disparagement; but so it is, that in the course of the century which
     has elapsed since Whitby and Middleton, a yet more disrespectful,
     because more summary, way of dealing with the Fathers has become
     current. Whitby and Middleton did think it necessary to appear to
     have examined what is really to be found in Antiquity; and the
     former especially exhibits, throughout his treatise above-mentioned,
     what on his principles must be called a morbid anxiety, to confirm
     his own views on several important subjects, (on original sin, for
     example, and the natural condition of infants,) by the testimony of
     the very writers, whom he is most busy in disparaging. But in our
     day, perhaps, the more usual course is, for persons who do not even
     profess any acquaintance with those writers, beyond vague
     impressions received from report or quotation, to dispose of their
     authority in any controverted point, under the notion, understood or
     expressed, that "the Fathers were Mystics, and need not be regarded
     at all."

     (2.) Now, if it were indeed an object with the Evil Spirit, to decry
     the relics of Christian Antiquity, and divert men's attention
     from them, it is difficult to say what single word he could have
     chosen, so critically adapted to his purpose in our days, as this
     same word, Mysticism. In the first place, it is not a hard word,
     having been customarily applied to such writers as Fenelon and
     William Law, whom all parties have generally agreed to praise and
     admire. So far it suits well with the smoothness of phrase, on which
     the present generation especially prides itself. It seems to got
     down the Fathers gently, and so is readily acquiesced in by many,
     who would shrink from the coarse sneers of Middleton or Gibbon.

     In the next place, it touches the very string, which most certainly
     moves contemptuous thought, in those who have imbibed the peculiar
     spirit of our time. Mysticism, implies a sort of confusion between
     physical and moral, visible and spiritual agency, most abhorrent to
     the minds of those, who pique themselves on having thoroughly clear
     ideas, and on their power of distinctly analysing effects into their
     proper causes, whether in matter or in mind.

     Again, Mysticism conveys the notion of, something essentially and
     altogether remote from common sense and practical utility: but
     common sense and practical utility are the very idols of this age.

     Further, that which is stigmatized as Mysticism, is almost always
     something, which at once makes itself discerned by internal
     evidence. The man of the world, the practical man, the inductive
     experimental philosopher, commonly persuades himself that lie can
     "perceive" by instinct, when a train of thought, or mode of speaking
     is mere religious dreaming, indistinct fanciful theory; and he
     rejects it accordingly and is saved all trouble of research. Here,
     again, is no small temptation, in the eyes of a world full of hurry
     and business, to acquiesce over lightly in any censure of that kind.

     Yet, again, if any man be disposed to speak and think more harshly
     of the early Christian writers, this same term, Mysticism, may serve
     his purpose also; for it is easy, by a dexterous enunciation, or
     choice of context, to insinuate through it a charge of Deliberate
     fraud. It is an instance, therefore, of a. mode of speaking, equally
     convenient for all shades and degrees of enmity to, or, contempt of,
     Antiquity. We see what its power is in a kindred instance; bow
     meanly even respectable persons allow, themselves to think of the
     highest sort of poetry,-that which invests all things, great and
     small, with the noblest of all associations,-when once they have
     come to annex to it the notion of Mysticism. And perhaps its
     mischievous effects on theology are as great as any attributable to
     a single word.

     (3.) It may, therefore, be of some use to consider, as distinctly as
     we can, what people really mean when they charge the Fathers with
     Mysticism; which being done, we may perhaps have a better chance of
     making out to our satisfaction, whether, and how far as a body, they
     deserve the charge.

     By the term Mysticism, then, as applied to the writers in question,
     I understand to be denoted, a disposition, first, to regard things
     as supernatural which are not really such; and secondly, to press
     and strain what may perhaps be really supernatural in an undue and
     extravagant way.

     (4.) Upon which bare statement, without going any further, a devout
     mind will probably at once acknowledge, on which side in the present
     question the peril of erring will be greatest. The question is like
     that of the general evidences of religion: a person who would go
     into it with advantage, should be imbued beforehand with a kind of
     natural piety, which will cause him to remember all along, that
     perhaps, when be comes to tile end of @is- inquiry, lie will find
     that God was all the while really there. He will "put off his shoes
     from off his feet," if he do but think it possible that an, angel
     may tell him, by and by, "The place where thou standest is holy
     ground." So it must be, in some measure, with every right-minded
     person, in the examination of every practice and opinion, against
     which the charge of Mysticism is brought. Whatever may appear in the
     case at first sight, likely to move scorn or ridicule, or tempt to
     mere lightness of thought; it will be an exercise of faith, a trial
     of a serious heart, to repress for the time any tendency of that
     kind: the loss and error being infinitely greater, if we are found
     trifling with a really sacred subject, than if we merely prove to
     have been a little more serious than was necessary. In this sense,
     that is to say in regard of the reverent or irreverent temper, in
     which such inquiries may be approached, superstition is surely a
     great deal better than irreligion: whatever may be thought of the
     abstract question, Whether it be the safer extreme to believe too
     much, or too little?

     It may be said, that the Fathers themselves indicate an exception to
     this rule, by the light and sarcastic way, in which they often allow
     themselves to treat the pretended mysteries, sometimes of heathens,
     sometimes of heretics as bad as heathens. But the case is not
     strictly in point. For I am speaking of pretensions unexamined, and
     therefore, as yet, more or less doubtful: but the Fathers had, or
     accounted themselves to have, good grounds for believing that the
     mysteries and miracles which they held up to scorn were, in part at
     least, the work of evil spirits, with whom they thus most
     effectually renounced communion. Before we indulge the like feeling
     in our treatment of any claim to supernatural powers, we had need
     have the like assurance of diabolical agency in them: and that to
     show them any reverence would seem like imparting of God's
     honour to the Evil One. Although even in such a case deep fear and
     humiliation of heart would seem the more appropriate sentiment for
     ordinary Christians. For is it not a fearful and humbling thought,
     that mankind, that we ourselves, are, or have been, in danger of
     mistaking the work of God's enemy for his own?

     Further, it may be well to bear in mind, that the noblest and most
     refined devotional tendencies have always had to bear the imputation
     of Mysticism, or some other equivalent word; as if to cultivate them
     were a mere indulgence of a dreamy, soaring, indistinct fancy. In
     this use of it, the word Mysticism has done probably as much barm in
     checking high contemplative devotion, as the kindred term,
     Asceticism, in discouraging Christian self-discipline.

     Thus much for the first impression, which the very application of
     the term to the Fathers would make on a considerate person, as yet
     ignorant of their writings. He would expect, almost certainly, to
     find them imbued with devotional feelings of an unusually high
     order; and he would be prepared for the possibility, that even those
     views of theirs, which might seem at first glance overstrained,
     fantastic, or unnatural, might turn out in the end to be portions of
     true Christian wisdom.

     (5.) What now are the particulars of the Fathers' imputed
     Mysticism? i.e. in what respects would they be commonly charged with
     an undue anxiety to make out supernatural meanings and
     interferences? The following heads would seem to comprehend the
     greater part of their supposed delinquencies in this kind:
    1. Their interpretations of Scripture are said to be far-fetched and
       extravagant; extracting figurative, theological allusions out of
       the most irrelevant or insignificant details of language or
       history.
    2. Correspondent to this is their mode of treating natural objects,
       and the truths of philosophy and common life; fancying every where
       indications of that system, on which their own hearts were set.
    3. They were mystics in their notions of providential interference,
       whether in the way of judgement, deliverance, or warning. To which
       head may be referred whatever they state of the exercise of the
       gift of prophecy in their times; as also their accounts of reputed
       miracles, and of the sensible agency of evil spirits, and of their
       own and others' warfare with them.
    4. Finally, they are blamed for Mysticism, properly so called, in
       their moral and devotional rules; i. e. for dwelling too much on
       counsels of perfection, tending (as is affirmed) to contemplation
       rather than action, to monastic rather than social and practical
       virtue.

     These are the sort of imputations on which the changes have been
     rung, for the two last centuries, by those who have wished to evade
     the testimony of the Fathers, without setting them down distinctly
     as deliberate impostors.

     (6.) It may be added, that many of their professed advocates,
     (Warburton for example,) have in fact given up their cause, as far
     as concerns every one of these representations. For what, in
     reality, does his defense of them come to, even when he is led to
     state their case most favourably; e. g. in the Preface to Julian?
     Just to this, and no more: that they might be trusted in their
     relations of things which came within the scope of their own
     knowledge, provided there was no room for surmising any thing
     miraculous: and again, that on other subjects, whether as reasoners
     or as narrators, they, were not weaker, but a little wiser, than
     Pagan and Jewish writers of the same date.

     It is true that Warburton belonged to a school, which has a
     temptation of its own for slighting the Fathers, over and above
     differences in particular doctrines; a school, whose leading
     principle is, that theology, like other sciences, improves by time:
     or, (to use the words of one of its most plausible advocates) that
     "Christianity was in its infancy, at most in its childhood, when
     these men wrote; and therefore it is no wonder that they spake as
     children, that they understood as children, that they thought as
     children. This was according to the economy they were then under^4."

     Such writers, when they speak most modestly of themselves, and most
     respectfully of antiquity, do not however hesitate to make use of
     the old simile, of a dwarf seeing further than a giant when raised
     on a giant's shoulders; imagining it to be as applicable to
     religion, as it is to physical and human learning; and, when they
     would most appear to advocate the ancients, cannot of course refrain
     from stigmatizing them as inadequate judges of Christian truth,
     infected sometimes with Platonic, sometimes with Rabbinical error:
     and thus, while with a sort of candour they excuse the men at the
     expense of the age, they do the Adversary's work, by detracting
     from their authority, and withdrawing attention and deference from
     their writings.

     But even those who in their hearts really loved to lean on
     Antiquity, and would have been uneasy, if they bad not the suffrage
     of the Fathers with them, have not always taken the course most
     likely to win them due respect. Whether it were that they feared to
     commit themselves,---or that they shrunk before popular
     notions,---or as a mere matter of taste and feeling,-the
     champions of the Fathers, for many years past, have generally been
     content to claim credit for them only as witnesses to certain
     palpable facts of their time: the inevitable consequence of which
     has been, that even diligent and earnest inquirers have been
     satisfied with a second-hand knowledge of their writings; and often,
     when they have come in to fill their proper place in argumentative
     discussions, they have nevertheless been far from occupying the room
     which justly belonged to them, in our theological views and
     impressions. There are, and have been, praiseworthy attempting to
     raise their credit, by drawing attention to those portions of their
     literature, which seemed to have most in common with modern ideas,
     whether in the way of general reasoning with unbelievers, or of
     refined devotional feeling, or of eloquent morality. But the very
     circumstance of such selections being made with a view to modern
     prejudices, shows that they can do no more than palliate the evil.
     When a reader passes from specimens of that kind to the whole body
     of any Father's writings, he is apt to feel as if he had been
     unfairly dealt with, and is inclined rather to be the more
     intolerant of the many things which be is sure to meet with, alien
     to his former tastes and habits of thought.

     (7.) May it not with reason be suspected,, that the root of the
     matter lies deeper, and that in order to arrive at it, we must make
     up our minds thoroughly to consider the whole subject ab initio? It
     may perhaps turn out that the boldest way of meeting the difficulty
     is the most rational, and ultimately the most consoling. We must not
     be startled, though we find ourselves compelled to own, that modern
     and ancient theology, are to a great extent irreconcileable; that if
     popular notions are right, the Fathers are indeed "mystical" in a
     bad sense, and that, in all the several departments above mentioned.
     Thus, in respect, first, of Scripture interpretation, the received
     doctrine of this age seems to be, that nothing ought to be
     figuratively or typically explained, except on the authority of
     Scripture itself^5; it being assumed, that we can no otherwise be
     certified of the divinely intended relation, necessary to make up
     the nature of a real Type. Now those who hold this rule must
     necessarily think meanly of the Fathers as expounders of Scripture,
     since in every paragraph almost we find some allegory, not
     scriptural according to the required test.

     Secondly, in respect of allusions moral or theological, regularly
     and uniformly deduced from the contemplation of the creatures of
     God, in the manner, e. g. of Boyle's Occasional Reflections; it
     would probably be considered a candid judgment, in our time, which
     should allow that such might constitute tolerable poetry: - but to
     consider them as a part of theology, to regard them as having been
     from the beginning intended by the Creator, and the creation ordered
     with a view to them;-who is there among us, that would not first be
     tempted to reject such a theory as overstrained and merely fanciful?

     Thirdly, consider the tone of thought, which is accounted safest and
     meets with most encouragement in our clays, concerning the
     intimations of God's mysterious providence, whether national or
     individual. Is it not a subject, that, as things are, even
     sincere-minded persons shrink from? They are afraid of trusting
     themselves with it, though but in thought. What is meant will be
     perceived in a moment, if people will reflect what their first
     impressions were, on reading, c. g., the Journal of Archbishop Laud,
     those portions, of it which detail supposed providential warnings.
     Or, again, how backward we all find ourselves in Confessing our
     sense of God's judgments, public and private, when in our
     thoughts we can hardly fail to perceive them. I am far from
     asserting that this backwardness is not both pious and reasonable,
     taking all circumstances into account: but does it not imply a great
     change, either in men's condition or opinions, or in both,
     since the days of St. Ignatius and St. Cyprian?

     Lastly, the difference in moral sentiments is too obvious to be
     denied. The cheerful, liberal, indulgent side is the popular one,
     now, in all questions of ethics: severity, strictness, self-denial,
     are but so far approved, as their immediate good effect is seen and
     understood. Need it be remarked, that the direct contrary is the
     case of the Primitive Church?

     On the whole, the discrepancies between the two ages, occasioning
     the imputation of Mysticism to the ancients, are far beyond being
     accounted for by local, accidental, or temporary circumstances, they
     must be referred to some difference in first principles: and, unless
     we are prepared to say positively, with the philosophic theologians
     above mentioned, that theology is, like other sciences, really
     advancing, of course, as the world grows older; we cannot but in
     candour allow it at least possible, before examination, that the
     ancients may have been in the right, and we in the wrong.

     (8.) In order to judge of this fairly, one should begin by stating,
     with its due limitations, the real judgment of Christian Antiquity
     on the several matters above enumerated,-an undertaking evidently
     far beyond the limits of such an essay as the present: one can only
     endeavour to give some faint specimen of the results, which, it is
     conceived, more extensive inquiry would establish; premising,
     however, the following cautions, as necessary to be kept in view
     throughout the inquiry.

     First, that since we are to speak of the Fathers collectively, we
     must be careful to select those points, in which they exhibit a
     tolerably general agreement. This limitation disposes at once of
     many of the most plausible objections to the views of Antiquity, and
     also of many of the unworthy and inadequate allegations of its timid
     defenders; as I hope to show hereafter in some important examples.

     But to make the rule a practical one, we should well understand,
     secondly, what is to be accounted general agreement among the
     Fathers. For it is the third particular in the rule of Vincentius,
     Quod ab omnibus, which has ever afforded most scope for cavil to the
     rationalist, and for perplexity to the unwary. But let us only apply
     to this matter the same rules of common sense, which guide us on
     analogous subjects in ordinary life. A person not regularly trained
     in medicine desires to know what are safe rules of diet: is he to
     believe that there are no such rules at all, because he finds none
     from which, at some time or other, ingenious innovators have not
     contrived to dissent? Another wishes to ascertain some point of
     common law: does be think it necessary for that purpose, that cases
     in all points exactly like his own shall have come under the
     cognisance of each former generation of jurists? Or, in matters of
     navigation, would it be said there were no fixed rules, because but
     a few out of many seamen have left the results of their experience
     any where on record? The question about the Fathers is so far like
     these, that it is strictly a question of practice: men, want to know
     which is the safest way in regard of their duty towards God; if they
     require in every point absolute inevitable demonstration, of course
     they cannot have it in the Fathers: but do they really think they
     find it in Holy Scripture?

     Certainly many of the principles most relied on by DaillÃ© and other
     such writers, are such that, if we followed them out, we should not
     stop short of universal scepticism. E. g. Whitby lays it down as an
     axiom^6, That if Scripture be a perfect rule of faith, it must be so
     clear in necessary things as to require no interpreter ; and that it
     cannot be a rule or measure where it is obscure. Might he not as
     reasonably have said, that it cannot be a rule to any one who does
     not thoroughly understand the languages in which it was originally
     written? Such sentiments are, in fact, inconsistent with the present
     condition of man: they deal with us as though we might be
     independent of human testimony, or arrive at mathematical certainty
     in moral matters. We can only be safe by putting them aside, and
     resolving to use, on this subject, the same kind of intuitive good
     sense, which is given us for our guide in all other matters or
     conduct; which good sense, as even heathen moralists could discern,
     is the ordinary accompaniment and providential reward of
     intellectual fairness and purity.

     Nor can any measure of general agreement be laid down, in words so
     precise, as not to leave a great deal to the exercise of this
     practical wisdom. However, one obvious rule would be, not to demand
     coincidence in detail, but in general principles; and again, in
     those generals only, which belong to the professed subject matter,
     and scope of the writers. For example, there is hardly one of the
     Fathers, of whose works we have any considerable quantity remaining,
     but has left on record his interpretation of one part or another of
     the Old Testament, in sufficient quantity to indicate his rules of
     exposition. Now, who will deny that it would be a very remarkable
     fact, should those rules be found, on the whole, the same throughout
     the whole series of Catholic Fathers;-a fact on which important
     conclusions may depend? and yet it may so happen, that no one
     passage in the Bible is quoted by them all; and again, that there
     are no two of theme who agree in their explanations of all the
     passages they quote.

     Again; it may be, that in the detail of some historical facts, or in
     some abstract principles not immediately bearing on theology, there
     may exist a general, not to say an universal, agreement, on which,
     nevertheless, very little can be built, because on such things they
     may very well be supposed to have taken for granted what was
     generally received in their age. Or, if they differ, such difference
     rather illustrates their concurrence on the great ecclesiastical
     subjects; for it proves the activity of their minds, and their
     energy in judging for themselves, where religion permitted.

     For example, among the opinions attributed to the Fathers as
     erroneous, we find^7 the notion of the soul in its separate state
     having a kind of body or sensible form, an aÃ«rial e 'i d w l o
     n , or vehicle (as it has sometimes been called). And again, we find
     cited^8, as a specimen of the discrepancies of Catholic writers, the
     opposite conjectures of St. Augustine and St. Jerome on the
     origination of the soul. Now, these are metaphysical not theological
     points; they fall not within the province of Christian Antiquity as
     such; on such points, neither discrepancy nor agreement in error
     proves any thing against the Fathers, as Divines.

     (9.) As then common sense teaches, that in judging collectively of
     that large and miscellaneous body of literature, which goes under
     the name of the Fathers, we must select those points, if any, which
     are common to the, whole mass; and again, that when we speak of
     agreement among them, we must mean agreement in principle not in
     detail, and on Christian not on secular subjects

     so a little ecclesiastical knowledge will suggest to us another
     consideration, very needful to be borne in mind, when we are
     estimating the value of their concurrence in any point within their
     sphere,-I mean the reverential reserve, which undoubtedly they
     practised in every part of religion, in proportion to its
     sacredness. If we would deal fairly with the subject, we must make
     allowance for this reserve. Knowing for certain that it did exist,
     we are bound to take it into the account, and often to give those
     who wrote under its influence credit for a more thorough agreement
     in high and mysterious doctrines, than their words at first sight
     would otherwise appear to express. One very remarkable instance,
     which it is enough just to mention now, it having been of late amply
     illustrated, is - the doctrine of the Ante-Nicene Fathers concerning
     the Divinity of the Son of God. Another is the rule of solemnization
     of the Holy Sacraments. A reader, versed in liturgical language,
     will often discover in the writings of the Fathers, sometimes in
     Scripture itself, allusions to the sacraments conveyed in one word
     or syllable, allusions primÃ¢ facie so faint, that we could hardly
     dare to reason upon them, were we not aware of the duty of reserve
     which would hinder the writers from more express disclosure of the
     particulars of those Holy Mysteries.

     (10.) It may be well to add one more caution, relating particularly
     to the interpretation of Scripture. Like all questions of language,
     especially poetical language, it is to every one of us in some
     decree a matter of taste: we come to it prepossessed with certain
     conventional rules, or certain associations of our own, which cling
     by us in spite of ourselves, and often affect our reasonings more
     than we are aware. But as the Scripture itself, both in substance
     and in form, is surely far unlike what mere human wisdom would have
     anticipated, so it is more than possible, that the true method of
     interpreting it may conduct us on a very different line, from any
     which would be pointed out by merely human criticism. It seems
     reasonable, therefore, and religious, to come to questions of that
     kind, expecting to meet with many things, which may at first seem
     strange or fanciful, or otherwise unworthy of Divine wisdom; to make
     up our minds beforehand, that we will not be too much startled by
     such things, nor reject them at once, but try them by their proper
     measures; lest we be found deferring to our own prejudices, rather
     than to the truth of God:-prejudices, not so much of opinion, as of
     rhetorical or poetical taste.

     Under such impressions, we may safely approach the first bead of
     Mysticism imputed to the Fathers, viz. their mode of interpreting
     Holy Scripture.

        Â§ii.-Specimen of ancient Mysticism in interpreting Scripture.

     (1.) First, as to the matter of fact ; we need not perhaps hesitate
     to admit in the most unreserved way,---indeed it might be hard to
     find any one who has ever denied,---the universal adoption, by
     the early Christian writers, of the allegorical way of expounding
     the Old Testament. They do undoubtedly profess to find an intended
     figurative and Christian meaning, in innumerable places, which are
     neither express prophecies, nor alluded to as types in the New. Not
     only in the prophetical writings do they find our Lord and His
     Gospel every where ; not only do they trace throughout the Levitical
     services the example and shadow of the future heavenly things; but
     they deal also in the same way with the records of history, whether
     Patriarchal or Jewish ; and with the fragments which the Holy Ghost
     has caused to be preserved out of the moral and devotional poetry of
     the Hebrews,---the Book of Job, the Psalms, and the Proverbs, and
     (what is in some respects the most significant and remarkable
     instance of all) the Song of Solomon from beginning to end.

     The general fact is doubtless familiar to all; being constantly
     produced, on the one hand, by the assailants of the
     Fathers---(for "whole books," as Middleton contemptuously says^9,
     "have been compiled of their foolish reasonings in religion
     ;")---nor, on the other band, has their exercise of this mode of
     interpretation been ever disputed, as a fact, by their defenders :
     whether it has been duly appreciated by the writers of either party,
     is altogether another question. Nowhere, perhaps, among our English
     divines, will the subject be found treated more thoughtfully or more
     worthily, than by Bishop Fell, in his notes on St. Cyprian, and on
     the Apostolical Fathers. However, in so great a consent of
     witnesses, one may state the case largely without presumption, and
     without affecting more than a superficial knowledge of Antiquity.

     (2.) Let it then be taken for granted, that a mode of expounding,
     which would seem to most men fanciful and strained, generally
     prevails in the Christian writers of the first centuries. The great
     point will be, to account in some measure for this fact. In order to
     which it may be expedient, not by way of proof but of illustration,
     if we take some one remarkable instance, and trace it as we may
     through the writings of some of the most eminent and earliest
     Fathers. And, not to give them any undue advantage, it may be well
     to select one of those subjects, their treatment of which is
     commonly considered most extravagant ; a subject, which has
     attracted towards them in no common degree the contemptuous wonder
     of modern critics and philosophers : I mean, their discovering
     tokens of our Lord's Passion, and more especially the Sign of
     the Cross, in innumerable places of the Old Testament, which neither
     are so expounded in the New, nor to common eyes betray of themselves
     any such allusion.

     (3.) To begin with the Epistle attributed to St. Barnabas ; it is
     well known how unreservedly it adopts the allegorical mode of
     interpretation. Supposing it not to be written by the
     Apostle,---a supposition which involves no charge of forgery,
     since it no where professes to be his; and in which it, may not be
     wrong to acquiesce, rather, however, for want of ecclesiastical
     testimony to its genuineness, than for any thing unworthy of such an
     origin to be discovered in the epistle itself,---it is
     undoubtedly by the manner in which St. Clement of Alexandria quotes
     it, a monument of the age next after the Apostles, and almost as
     undoubtedly, judging by internal evidence, it was meant as what in
     our days would be called popular hortatory tract, intended to
     reconcile the Christians of the circumcision to the utter rejection
     of the Jewish people. And by one expression in it^10, we may perhaps
     reasonably assign its date, to the year 136 or thereabouts; when
     Adrian, having overthrown the rebel Jews under Bar Cochab, was most
     active in building Ã/-lia on the site of Jerusalem, and a Gentile
     Christian Church was beginning to flourish there. To this, as it may
     seem, the author of the Epistle applies the prophecy of Isaiah,
     (xlix. 17.) according to the reading of the LXX : ;"Thou shalt
     be quickly builded by those who were thy destroyers:" this,'
     says he, ;is now in course of accomplishment. For their rising
     in war led to the subversion of their city by their enemies ; but
     now the very servants of the same enemies are building it up
     again.'

     This date deserves notice, because it suggests a sufficient reason
     for the freedom with which the author, in a popular tract, exhibits
     the method of symbolical exposition, which was generally rather
     withdrawn from ordinary eyes. The calamity, perhaps, was great and
     astounding enough to justify disclosures otherwise irregular, for
     the, consolation and establishment of the faithful. However, certain
     it is that this epistle, which is addressed to Christian men and
     women without distinction, might be not unfitly selected for a
     specimen of the mystical way, as applied to the old Testament.

     (4.) As concerning the Passion and Cross of our Lord in particular,
     (to say nothing of the sacrifice of Isaac, the typical nature
     whereof, as it seems, no age of Christians has ever denied,
     notwithstanding the silence of Scripture,) St. Barnabas has the
     following passage^11 : ;Israel being attacked by the aliens,
     with a view amongst other things, of signifying to the people, that
     their transgressions were the cause of their being given over to
     death, the Spirit speaks inwardly to Moses, to form a type of the
     Cross, and of Him who was to suffer : that if men refuse to trust in
     Him, they will have no peace for ever. Moses therefore places one
     shield on another in the middle of the mound and being thus posted
     high above all, he stretches out his hands, and so Israel began
     again to be victorious : afterwards, when on the contrary he let
     down his hands, again they were slaughtered. Wherefore? That men
     might know there is no chance of salvation, except they put their
     trust in Him. And in another prophet he says, "All the day long I
     have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying
     people."' What is very observable, the Author next goes, on to
     mention, with just the same confidence, and no more the, typical
     meaning of the Brasen Serpent : observing, with his usual piety,
     "Thou hast in the glory of Jesus; that in Him, and to Him are all
     things.

     Had it seemed good to God's providence, that the discourse of
     our Lord to Nicodemus should have been lost, as so many other of His
     divine words were, would not the Christian interpretation of this
     latter miracle have seemed to many forced, and fanciful, just as
     that of that of the former may perhaps seem now? And ought not this
     single consideration to stop the mouths of all, who have any
     reverence in their hearts, when they find themselves tempted to join
     in hasty censure or scorn of such, interpretations? For aught they
     know, they may be scorning or censuring the very lessons of our
     Divine Master Himself.

     (12.) I proceed to another, historical type, which to many may
     appear more extravagant. The Author is reasoning on the history of
     Abraham, to prove the insufficiency of Jewish circumcision out of
     the Old Testament itself. So far, as, will occur to every one, he is
     treading in the steps of St. Paul. After producing many passages to
     that purpose, he closes the subject with the following^12 :
     ;Consider whether there be not abundant instruction on this
     whole matter, in the account given us that Abraham, who first gave
     men circumcision, did thereby, perform a spiritual and typical
     action, looking forward to the Son: and that, upon receiving certain
     doctrines conveyed in three (mystical) letters. For He saith,
     Abraham circumcised of his house, men to the number of three hundred
     and eighteen. What then is the mysterious truth thus vouchsafed to
     him? Observe the eighteen first, then the three hundred. Of the two
     letters, which stand for 18, 10 is represented by "I", 8 by "H".
     Thou hast here the word Jesus :' i. e., the two first letters,
     which formed as it were a cypher of the sacred Name, familiar to the
     eyes and thoughts of the Christians of that generation : as was also
     the third of the numeral letters in question, which the writer next
     goes on to explain : ;Because the Cross, which is signified to
     the eye by the letter Tau, was intended to bring the grace, [to
     which he looked forward ;] he adds the three hundred also,' the
     letter Tau representing that number. ;By the two first letters
     then the name Jesus is indicated, and by the third the cross.'

     On this commentary, which as well as the former has been adopted by
     multitudes of the early interpreters^13, several remarks occur,
     which it may be well to put down, as they will each of them apply to
     a whole class of examples, and to difficulties which are certain to
     arise in many of our minds, though we were never so resolutely on
     our guard against prejudices of mere taste and association.

     (13.) First, it may be observed that the several circumstances,
     which may appear at first sight startling in this exposition, though
     not perhaps united in any one Scriptural example, have yet, each
     severally, undoubted sanction of Scripture. Thus, the use of the
     numeral letters as a cypher to convey some mysterious truth has a
     well-known precedent in the Book of Revelation. Again the passage in
     St. Barnabas is an instance of the combination of texts apparently
     remote, but really bearing on the same subject : for the number,
     three hundred and eighteen, is not mentioned in the account of the
     circumcision of Abraham's family, but is borrowed from the
     previous enumeration occasioned by, the war with Chedorlaomer^14.
     Now, this sort of combination of remote texts appears to be
     warranted, in one instance at least, by our blessed Lord Himself.
     ;Is it not written, ;My house shall be called of all
     nations the house of prayer?'" So far is taken from Isaiah, but
     the conclusion of the sentence, ;Ye have made it a den of
     thieves,' was addressed by Jeremiah to a subsequent
     generation^15.

     Now whether the fact were really so or not, (if it were, it was
     surely by special providence,) that Abraham's household at the
     time of circumcision was exactly the same number as before : still
     the argument of St. Barnabas will stand. As thus : circumcision had
     from the beginning a reference to our Saviour, as in other respects,
     so in this ; that the mystical number, which is the cypher of Jesus
     crucified, was the number of the first circumcised household, in the
     strength of which Abraham prevailed against the powers of the world.
     So St. Clement of Alexandria^16, as cited by Fell^17 : "It is
     commonly supposed that we have here an indication of a
     correspondency between the case of Abraham's household and the
     method of salvation : of the victory obtained by those who have
     betaken themselves to the Holy Sign and Name, over those who led
     them captive, and the innumerable tribes of unbelievers who follow
     in their train."

     (14.) Nor is warrant of Scripture wanting for that which must
     otherwise seem most inadmissible in this interpretation; the appeal,
     namely, to the Greek Bible, as having, something like divine
     authority. And this again is a topic which meets us throughout the
     remains both the Greek and Latin Fathers. The Septuagint, and Latin
     versions clearly made from it are everywhere unscrupulously quoted
     as the words of inspiration ; with the exception, perhaps, of St.
     Jerome. Some of the Fathers' opponents would insinuate, that
     this rests on the tradition reported by Aristeas, of a miraculous
     consent among the original translators, even in the minutest point.
     But this is refuted by the language, of St. Augustine, who speaks
     doubtfully of that tradition, but without any doubt of this
     particular version being, so overruled by a prophetic Spirit^18 that
     even in, those places where it swerved from the Hebrew Verity, there
     was a special providential design in such variation^19.

     Now, can it be denied, that this idea receives countenance from the
     mode in which the Old Testament is quoted in the New? In the Epistle
     to the Hebrews, for example, St. Paul argues at large the necessity
     of the Mediator's death, from the use of the word d i a q Â¢ h
     k h , "Testament," in the LXX to represent that Hebrew word which is
     commonly translated Covenant. "For this cause," says he, "it is a
     New Testament, of which Christ is said to be Mediator, that by means
     of death the called might receive the promise ; for where a
     Testament is pleaded, the death of the testator must necessarily be
     alleged. For a Testament is valid in the case of the dead, since it
     never avails, as long as the testator is alive^20." And he goes on
     to show how the word was applicable to the Mosaic covenant also, i.
     e. by the typical death of the sacrifices. Who does not see that
     this reasoning is grounded entirely in the Greek version? since the
     Hebrew (NA) does not in any way answer to the notion of a last will.
     St. Paul's reasoning implies, therefore, thus much at least
     concerning the LXX ; that in their rendering of this very critical
     word, they were providentially directed to the use of a term, which
     should convey an allusion to a great Christian mystery. And so far
     the Apostle warrants the judgment of St. Augustine^21 : "Whoever
     besides shall truly translate any portion of the Old Testament from
     Hebrew into another language:" (St. Jerome, of course, was in his
     mind :) "his version will be found either to agree with that of the
     LXX or if it appears not to agree, in that very disagreement we must
     believe that there exists some deep prophetic meaning." Nay, even
     St. Jerome, when he is impugning their authority, seems to own that
     there might exist in them a modified and inferior kind of
     inspiration. "I do^22 not condemn, I do not blame the LXX, but I
     confidently prefer the Apostles to them all. Christ speaks to me by
     the lips of those, concerning whom I read^23, that they stand even
     before Prophets in the order of spiritual gifts; in which order the
     interpretation of tongues occupies nearly the last place.

     We have seen that in one place at least this view is justified by
     the Scripture : and one place is sufficient for our present purpose,
     which is not to prove the LXX infallible, but to bespeak a certain
     reverence for their yet unexamined decisions, and for the constant
     appeals of the early, writers to them. For who can assure himself,
     that in any, variation, from the Hebrew, which seems to him most
     unaccountable, they were not guided by the same influence, which
     caused them to write Testament instead of Covenant, in the places
     referred to by St. Paul?

     (15.) To return to the passage in Genesis : in whatever measure the
     fact is made out, that the received Greek version of the Scriptures
     was under a peculiar providence, in the same degree it is rendered
     not improbable that even in such an apparently casual thing, as the
     number of Abraham's servants, there was an eye to the benefit
     and consolation which the Church should long after receive, on
     recognising, as it were, her Saviour's cypher, in the account
     of the one holy family triumphantly warring against the powers of
     the world. It, were a most inadequate judgment, to estimate that
     consolation by any of the feelings and opinions current in our time.
     We must go back to the days when Christians were used to carry about
     with them everywhere the Sign of the Cross; when, to use the
     forcible words of Tertullian^24 :

     "At every step and every movement, going out and coming in, dressing
     and putting on their sandals, at the bath, at the board, when lamps
     were lighted, when they lay down to rest, when they seated
     themselves for their daily task, whatever call of ordinary life
     engaged them, the Holy Sign, by incessant use, was, as it were worn
     into their foreheads."

     With such associations, it must have been a real joy to them, as
     often as they discovered the Cross in the Old Testament, where they
     had not marked it before: it was to them an outward and visible sign
     of their communion with Saints and Patriarchs of old, and of
     God's everlasting providence over both. It was moreover a
     permanent warning, intelligible to all, against the impiety, not
     unusual in those days of ascribing the two Testaments to different
     deities. People little know what they do, when they deal
     contemptuously with any thing, be it in Scripture or in common life,
     under the notion that it is too slight, too insignificant for the
     ordering of the Most High.

     (16.) All which considered, there appears no fanaticism, but a great
     deal of sober piety and charity, in the expressions of St. Barnabas
     on dismissing this topic. "He knows" the reality of this mystery
     "from whom we" Christians or Christian teachers, "derive the
     ingrafted gift of that teaching, which is properly His. Never have I
     ever delivered to anyone a more genuine exposition, but I am
     well-assured that you are meet to receive it."

     If the writer had been merely indulging his own fancy, this
     profession of reserve would be mere affectation. But surely, to
     esteem it such is too hard a supposition, considering the perfect
     simplicity and moral purity of the precepts at the end of the
     Epistle. His very tone and manner, then, creates an additional
     presumption, that the exposition that he had been giving was not
     private but ecclesiastical, and the sort of scruple, with which he
     imparts it, an instance of that discipline of reserve, which the
     Church recommended in the conveyance of all her mysteries.

     (17.) Neither need anyone be staggered at the idea, which his manner
     of speaking seems to imply, that Abraham himself was not ignorant of
     this mystery; a notion upon which Dr. Whitby has built what he
     conceives to be a triumphant refutation of the allegory. "The Hebrew
     letter Tau^25," he observes, "neither bears the form of the
     Cross^26, nor is the symbol of the number three hundred ; and as to
     the Greek letters, they were not invented till long after
     Abraham's time." Well ; but does St. Barnabas affirm that
     Abraham himself knew the meaning of the Greek cypher? If he did, he
     might suppose it made known by prophetic inspiration; according to
     the received exposition of the text in St. John, "Your father
     Abraham rejoiced to see my day." But what are St. Barnabas' own
     words? "He circumcised his family, l a b w n t r i v n g r a m m Â¢
     a t w n d Ã³g m a t a , after he had received the doctrines of the
     three letters." I. e. certain mysterious truths, of which the three
     symbols were to be a symbol. It is not said that he received them by
     the three letters.

     Again, after stating the number of the household, he asks, t Ãz o u
     n h d o q e i s a t o u t w g n w s i z ; which may be perhaps best
     construed, "What is the evangelical meaning of the signs given to
     him?" taking g n w s i z objectively, for the truth sealed up, not
     subjectively, for the impression on Abraham's mind. It is not
     therefore necessary to understand St. Barnabas as asserting that the
     holy Patriarch himself had this secret revealed to him. For any
     thing he affirms, it might be a g n w s i z , the outward cypher of
     which only was given to Abraham, the key reserved for the times of
     our Lord and His Gospel.

     And after all, a mistake in that particular could not fairly
     invalidate the whole interpretation. There is a school of
     theologians, which maintains that Abel must have known the full
     doctrine of the Atonement. Those who hesitate in allowing this, do
     not therefore doubt the typical and mystical import of Abel's
     history. So in this case, we might believe St. Barnabas, stating
     what was known in his time to be the signification of the three
     letters, while we demurred to his supposition, that it was known
     also to Abraham.

     (18.) There is yet one more instance, in this ancient epistle, of
     allegorical interpretation with reference to the Cross of our Lord :
     an instance which like the former may stand at the head of a class,
     and being well-considered, may throw much light on another wide
     province of the so-called mysticism of the Church. "Let us see,"
     says the writer^27, "whether the Lord has seen good to give men
     prophetical indications of the Water and the Cross." Then, after
     other texts, he alleges the first Psalm, "He shall be like a tree
     planted by the rivers of waters, that bringeth forth his fruit in
     his season ; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth
     shall prosper. The ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff which
     the wind driveth away; therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the
     judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. For the
     Lord knoweth the way of the righteous : but the way of the ungodly
     shall perish." Then, "Observe," says be, "how, distinctly the
     prophet has pointed out the tree and the water in combination. For
     what he says, comes to this : ;Blessed are they who, setting
     their hope in the cross, have descended into the water: for I will
     render their reward in its time,' i. e. hereafter. But for the
     present, the Psalmist adds, ;his leaf shall not wither,'
     i. e. every word which shall go out of your mouth in faith and love,
     shall be to the conversion and hope of many." The allusion to the
     Cross is here brief and obscure, turning as it does upon the single
     word t Ã² x u l o n . But the moral of the passage is surely most
     noble and beautiful. "The Cross, applied by Holy Baptism, gaining
     the victory over the powers of the world, is not only the pledge and
     mean, but also the emblem, of the faithful man's triumph over
     his spiritual enemies. It is the pattern, as its Lord is the giver,
     of all victory. And therefore, blessed is the man who walks strictly
     according to all the rules of a holy life for be is like the Cross
     Of Christ success is sure, his lot, to bear fruit eternally without
     stint or measure."

     Every one must admire the thought, but the question now is, how it
     is derived from the Psalm. The account of which, and of, many like
     texts, seems to be as follows : The old Christian writers, either by
     tradition, or by a feeling so general that it seemed almost like a
     natural instinct, believed that the phrase t Ã² x u l o n , wherever
     introduced in the Old Testament, was intended to lead their thoughts
     to the cross ; of which in their ordinary speech, t Ã² x u l o n was
     perhaps the most frequently appellative. Accordingly, not only such
     obvious analogies as Isaac bearing the wood of his sacrifice, the
     Brasen Serpent, or such a place as that in Isaiah, "The government,"
     i.e. the sign of power, the victorious Cross, "shall be upon his
     shoulder ;"---but every rod also, or staff or sceptre, mentioned
     by either of the sacred writers, as it was a token of guidance,
     support, or dominion, was, in the Fathers' judgment, a designed
     emblem of the Cross.

     (19.) The best way, perhaps, of exemplifying this, will be to
     transcribe from Justin Martyr's dialogue with Tryphon, which
     may be considered as a popular view of the primÃ¢ facie evidence for
     Christianity in the Old Testament, the remarkable passage^28 in
     which he undertakes to prove, that "since the time of our
     Lord's crucifixion, there hath been inseparably associated with
     Him that which is an emblem, on the one hand, of the tree of life,
     the plantation of which in Paradise had been matter of early
     revelation ; on the other hand, it is also an emblem of the course
     appointed by the Almighty for the righteous." This passage, then,
     professedly gives the view, which the Christians of Justin's
     time took of large portions of the ancient Scriptures: and it is
     noticeable also on another account, that it has attracted, the
     especial scorn of rationalist writers : the language, for example,
     of Middleton concerning it, is marked (I had almost said) by brutal
     irreverence^29. However, thus Justin proceeds :

     "Moses with a rod was sent to redeem the people ; and bearing this
     in his hand, in the place of sovereignty over them, he divided the
     Red Sea. It was by this that the rock gave forth water, gushing out
     in his sight. It was a tree which he cast into the waters of Marah,
     which being bitter were so made sweet. It was by means of rods cast
     into the water, that Jacob caused the sheep of his mother's
     brother so to conceive, that the young might fall to his share. With
     his rod, or staff, he, the same Jacob, passed over the water [of
     Jordan] as he himself boasts. He declared that a ladder had been
     seen by him, and that it was God Himself who was stationed on the
     top thereof, the Scripture hath expressly affirmed." This example is
     not irrelevant, since a ladder is part (so to speak) of the
     furniture of the Cross. Then having digressed on some other emblems
     occurring in the vision at Bethel, Justin goes on : "It was the rod
     of Aaron, which by its budding declared him the High Priest. That as
     a rod from the root of Jesse, Christ should be born, Isaiah foretold
     ; and David saith that the righteous man is as the tree planted by
     the river of waters, which shall bring forth fruit in its season,
     and his leaf shall not wither :" where we have Justin's
     sanction for the interpretation which St. Barnabas bad given before
     him. "Again, he saith, ;The righteous shall flourish like a
     palm.' From a tree God appeared to Abraham, as it is written,
     at the oak of Mamre. Seventy willows and twelve fountains the people
     found, having passed over Jordan. By a rod and a staff David affirms
     that he received comfort from his God. It was wood which Elisha cast
     into the river Jordan, and so brought up the iron of the axe,
     wherewith the sons of the prophets had gone forth, to cut timber for
     building that mansion, wherein it was their purpose to recite and
     study, the law and the commandments of God. Even as when we were
     plunged deep in the most grievous sins, which had been our practice,
     by His Crucifixion on the tree, and by the water of His
     Purification, our Christ redeemed us, and caused us to become an
     house of prayer and adoration [to Himself]. Also, it was a rod which
     manifested Judah to be the father of those [twins] who were so born
     of Thamar, as to exhibit a great mystery."

     (20.) From this enumeration, which contains in brief the substance
     of a great body of commentaries, the chain of ideas is at once
     apparent, which led to the mystical exposition of the first Psalm.
     As in the former instances, the uplifted arm of Moses, and the
     cypher inclosed in the number of Abraham's household, it was
     the form of the Cross which conveyed the divine intimation : so here
     the material of the Cross, is found imbued with the like
     emblematical virtues.

     Again, as St. Barnabas, had produced this Psalm as shadowing out a
     mystic combination of the Cross, and the Water, and therefore
     representing the condition of Christian people; so in almost all the
     anecdotes, parables, and allusions collected by Justin, the like
     combination is observable. Thus, to take the history of Moses, the
     virtue of his rod was shown at the Red Sea, and in bringing water
     out of the rock; the water of Marah was sweetened by the tree, which
     he cast in : the trees and fountains of Elim seen together, were the
     earnest of hope to the Israelites at their entrance on the
     wilderness. Elisha's causing iron to swim was a token, as we
     have seen, of our deliverance, "by the Crucifixion on the tree, and
     the water of purification."

     It will be at once seen what a strong light is thrown, by such a
     series of examples, on the doctrine of the Sacraments, as held by
     that generation. The Cross and the Water, it is taken for granted,
     go together to save a man.

     (21.) But in order to appreciate rightly the Fathers' reasoning
     in such places, we ought of course to recollect, that its force lies
     in the accumulation of instances. It is not necessary that: each
     anecdote, taken by itself, should be a complete type of the
     evangelical truth, at which the sum of the whole points : e. g.
     though a person questioned the distinct allusion to any Christian
     mystery, in the account, taken singly, of Jacob's using rods to
     influence the breed of Laban's cattle, still it must come in as
     one among many examples, to show how constantly the Almighty
     employed that material, which was to be the instrument of
     redemption, as a conveyance of temporal blessings to His chosen
     people.

     Nor must we omit the scriptural sanction, which may seem to be
     vouchsafed to this whole class of symbols, by the mention in the New
     Testament of the ark of Noah, on which Justin himself comments
     elsewhere in the following way^30. "In Isaiah it is said, by the
     Almighty to Jerusalem, I saved thee in the deluge of Noah," (He
     seems to be quoting, not in words but in sense in that. portion of
     the 54th chapter, "As I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no
     more overflow the earth, so have I sworn to be wroth, with thee no
     more.") Justin proceeds :

     "Now, this is the declaration of God, that the mystery of those who
     were saved by Christ was exhibited at the deluge. For the righteous
     Noah, with the rest at the deluge, being eight in number had a token
     of that eighth day, on which our Lord Christ showed Himself risen
     from the dead : the eighth day numerically, but virtually the first,
     from the beginning. For Christ, as He was the firstborn of every
     creature, so He became anew the beginning of a fresh race of men ;
     viz. that which was regenerated by Him, through Water and Faith ;
     and also, we may add, by wood, since wood expresses the mystery of
     the Cross. Even as Noah also was preserved by wood, floating upon
     the waters with those who belonged to him. When therefore the
     prophet says, ;I saved thee in Noah,' he is speaking to
     that people, who, like Noah, are faithful to God, and have the same
     tokens from Him that Noah had."

     Thus far St. Justin the Martyr, shewing how, in the history of the
     ark, there was a designed allusion to the Cross ; and by parity of
     reasoning justifying the like exposition, wherever it has seemed
     good to Almighty God to use the material of the Cross, namely wood,
     ;in the machinery, so to call it, of His miraculous providence,
     over those who, in their several ages, were to prepare, the way of
     His Christ.

     (22.) For this may be observed of all the instances, enumerated
     above from Jewish or Patriarchal history, (and I remark it on
     account of those especially, who may be inclined to treat the
     subject lightly) that, one and all, they are discernible links in
     the Providential chain above mentioned, they all relate to critical
     moments, in the history of the chosen seed. Thus the supernatural
     increase of Jacob's flocks by means of the rods, was the first
     great step towards the increase of the chosen family into a nation
     and again, Judah's staff, the producing of which as his token,
     stayed the sentence of death against Tamar, was thereby instrumental
     in preserving the life of her infant, in whom it was God's
     purpose to continue the chosen seed.

     Perceiving as we do in these cases, something of God's design
     in interfering, it surely becomes us to treat those traditions with
     reverence, which teach that in the manner of interfering He had
     respect continually to the end of the whole dispensation, i. e. to
     the Cross of His Son. And if we find other instances alleged, whose
     place in the divine oe;conomy we are as yet unable to make out
     let us, not rashly treat them as trifling or fanciful. If we do not
     see I their force at first, if they appear to us quaint and
     overstrained, it is surely possible that this our ignorance may be
     our own fault, or our own trial; it is no absolute proof that the
     old interpreters are wrong.

     (23.) In quitting for the present this subject, of the types of the
     Cross in the Old Testament, I would just remark further, that it
     furnishes a clear and instructive example of the manner in which the
     Fathers passed from one branch of mysticism into another from
     allegorizing the word of God, to spiritualizing His works. We have
     seen how they found, or thought they found a designed remembrancer
     and token of the Cross, wherever either its material or its form
     occurred in the Old Testament : and full as their minds evidently
     were of the Scriptures, it was but one step farther, to carry the
     same association with them, which way soever, they turned, in common
     life, or among natural objects. For example, so ordinary a sight as
     that of a flourishing tree by a river side could hardly fail to
     excite in a devout mind, thoroughly familiar with the Psalms, the
     remembrance of the description above quoted, with which that divine
     book, opens ; which description again, as we have seen, was in a
     primitive Christian's mind inseparable from thoughts of the
     Cross and of the Font.

     Here then, among God's visible ordinary works, we obtain a
     standing type or symbol, and,---bearing as it does the mark of
     selection by the Holy Ghost, may we not venture to call it a
     pledge,---of His great invisible work in Holy Baptism ; the grace
     of which, we are thus taught, diffusing a kind of insensible virtue
     through the whole of our renewed nature, causes a man to grow in the
     likeness of Christ, to partake more and more of His Cross, and so to
     have surer and surer hope, that "look, whatsoever he doeth, it shall
     prosper" for ever.

     By this and other like instances, a window being once opened for the
     lamps lighted within the Church to stream here and there upon the
     external world, it was rendered easy for a devout and contemplative
     mind to invent and pursue like trains of thought, in other
     instances, less expressly warranted in Scripture.

     (24.) To take an instance from the subject which has now employed us
     : the early Christian writers repeatedly point out, in nature and in
     common life, what they regard as designed providential limitations
     of the doctrine of redemption, or some part of it, by association
     either with the form or with the material of the Cross. This they
     do, not only in flights of devotional poetry, or in what might be
     considered the indulgence of a meditative imagination, but in
     serious argument even with unbelievers. So in Justin's
     well-known appeal, where he is asserting the dignity of the Cross^31
     he says :

     "Providentially, it was so ordered, that in no instance, in the
     legend of any of those who were called sons of Jupiter, did the Evil
     Spirits enact, the death of the Cross. For it was not understood by
     them, all the prophecies of it being symbolically expressed. Now the
     Cross, as one of the Prophets (Habakkuk) foretold, is the most
     potent symbol of His power and sovereignty ; as appears even from
     things daily before our eyes.

     "For consider all the affairs of the world : is there any, in the
     ordering and due combination whereof, this form does not occur?
     There is no crossing the sea, except this triumphant sign, which, in
     that instance, is formed by what they call the yard-arm, remain
     entire in the vessel: neither without it is there any plowing the
     land : either those who dig in the ground, nor those who work in
     handicrafts, can perform their task, but by tools having this form :
     nay and the human figure differs from animals without reason in
     nothing so much as in being erect, and in admitting extension of the
     hands each way :"

     (which association, we may remark by the way, Holy Scripture itself
     might suggest, by the posture of Moses ensuring the defeat of
     Amalek).

     But to proceed with Justin :

     "The human countenance, bears this also as a mark of distinction
     from brutes, that from the forehead the line of the nose is drawn
     out with a sort of prominence ; so that where the breath of life is
     drawn, there the lines exhibit no other figure than that of the
     Cross: which the Prophet also hath thus expressed^32 : ;The
     very breathing of our nostrils, is Christ the Lord.' Moreover
     your ensigns also, [he is speaking to the CÃ¦sars] express majesty
     by this form, wherewith you every where solemnize your processions ;
     in them exhibiting the signs of your sovereignty and power. It is
     so, though it be unconsciously done on your part. When your emperors
     die, their images in this form are dedicated by you; and in writing
     thereon, you style them gods."

     He concludes:

     "Thus, having urged you to the best of our power, both by reasoning,
     and by this appeal to a visible form, which is continually meeting
     your eyes, we consider ourselves to have done our part, and not to
     be responsible, should you remain unbelievers."

     (25.) One would have supposed, that at least the piety and good
     meaning of such trains of thought might remain unquestioned, by all
     believers in the Cross Of Christ, whatever judgment might be formed
     on their logical accuracy. Yet, so it is, that on passages of this
     kind a charge has been grounded against the Fathers of directing the
     "faith of their readers to the efficacy of the figure of the Cross,
     rather than to the Atonement made thereon." A charge, which might
     perhaps be tenable, could it be proven that the general views and
     conduct of the same Fathers were such as to contradict their truly
     believing the Atonement. Just as, if there were any persons, either
     in ancient or in modern times, who observed no rules of self-denial,
     we might conclude at once that any trust they had, or taught others
     to have, in "Christ crucified," was in fact a trust in a certain
     form of words not in the virtue itself of that blessed sacrifice.
     What was the Cross, as employed by the Fathers but a "Verbum
     visibile,' recalling to the minds of the baptized the very
     truth, which they are thus accused of slighting ; and to the heathen
     themselves conveying so much as this, that the Gospel was
     essentially a doctrine of the Cross, a doctrine of suffering in
     adherence to a crucified Redeemer? As an expressive symbol,
     therefore, or word, the Sign of the Cross was liable to the same
     abuse with words in general : the self-deceit of man might enable
     him sometimes to acquiesce in the sign without the thing signified ;
     and such a caution might be occasionally needed as Wesley is
     reported to have received from William Law : "Remember that a man
     may deceive himself as easily by the phrase, ;justification by
     faith,' as by any other combination of syllables."

     But supposing no such practical proof against them, may we not say,
     that the Fathers' veneration for the Cross is primÃ¢ facie as
     much a proof of their receiving the doctrine of Christ crucified, as
     any form of words in which they could possibly have expressed
     themselves? And there was this plain and material reason, for their
     preferring the visible symbol to any mode of speech, in treatises
     for general reading; that they did not thereby convey more
     knowledge, than the rule of the Church allowed, to those who were
     without, while to every baptized believer they conveyed intimations,
     deep and solemn in proportion to the depth of his faith.

     (26.) But not only with the figure of the Cross, but with its
     material also, the piety of those times associated recollections ;
     transferring, by an easy process, the mystical allusion, which the
     New Testament expressly sanctioned in the case of the ark ; not
     only, as before mentioned, to other scriptural facts, such as that
     of Elisha causing the iron to swim, but also to occasions of common
     life ; such, for example, as that mentioned by St. Cyprian, where he
     comforts certain imprisoned confessors, with thoughts, which to the
     world may seem merely enthusiastic and fanciful ; but let not its
     rashly apply such words to the reflections of holy men, suffering
     for the truth's sake, on the circumstances of their trial ;
     circumstances which others might term casual, but which they feel to
     be providential. Thus, I say, St. Cyprian writes, to Nemesianus and
     other confessors, condemned to the mines^33.

     The circumstance of your having been first beaten with staves, and
     by severe pain of that kind begun to solemnize the first glorious
     stage of your confession, has nothing in it that we need abhor, or
     earnestly deprecate. For those limbs of yours, christened as they
     were, and having all their hope in the Wood of the Cross, shrank not
     for terror from the wood of the persecutors' staves. The
     sacrament and token of his salvation was recognised by the servant
     of Christ. Redeemed before by wood to eternal life, by wood in
     another form he now finds himself borne onwards to his crown.

     This passage may serve as a specimen of the manner, in which those
     first Christian moralists improved things, seemingly trivial, to
     spiritual associations. Those who merely make light of such
     allusions, know little of the real comfort they are calculated to
     give, to minds over depressed, perhaps, by sickness or privation.
     And may we not also say, they know but little, I fear we all know
     far less than we ought, of that serious and thankful frame of mind,
     which fears to accept such consolations, without owning a special
     Providence in them, and regarding them as real tokens of the greater
     blessing, with which they are associated?

     So far we have traced the chief mystical expositions, relating to
     the Passion of our Lord, in the epistle of St. Barnabas ; and we
     seem to perceive that they are but so many specimens (so to call
     them) of as many groups of allusions, constantly occurring in the
     remains of the early Church.

     (27.) There is yet one other aspect, in which the Wood or Tree of
     the Cross was contemplated by the church of the first ages, viz. as
     a bearing a designed reference to the fatal wood, or tree of
     knowledge in Paradise. This is put plainly and forcibly by St.
     IrenÃ¦us, (v. 17,) in a passage, which it may be well to quote at
     length, as containing perhaps the beat illustration that can be
     given of this whole subject. He is demonstrating the harmony of the
     Old and New Testaments as different parts of the one great scheme of
     salvation. And having first pointed to the light thrown by the
     Incarnation of the Word on the statement, that man was created after
     God's image, he proceeds to argue on the Passion in the
     following way :

     "Not only thus did the Lord manifest both the Father and Himself,
     but also by His very Passion. For doing away with that disobedience
     of mankind, which from the beginning had taken place through the
     wood, or tree of knowledge, He became obedient unto death, even the
     death of the Cross. The rebellion, I say, which the one tree had
     occasioned, He heals by that submission, which was wrought in the
     other. Whereas, had He been announcing another Father, He could not,
     by this sameness of subject, have indicated His coming to do away
     with the disobedience which had been committed against, our Creator.
     But inasmuch as the very same things, which occasioned our refusal
     to hear and obey God's word, were the instruments whereby He
     introduced obedience and entire conformity to His word, He openly
     shows himself thereby to be that God, whom in the first Adam we
     offended, not performing His commandment; but in the second Adam we
     are reconciled to the same, having become obedient unto death. For
     to no other were we debtors, but to Him, whose commandment also we
     transgressed from the beginning."

     And presently after :

     "He hath blotted out the handwriting of our debt, and fixed it to
     His cross, that as by the tree we were made debtors to God, so by
     the tree we might receive remission of our debt. This hath been
     shown in symbol through many, but mare especially through the
     prophet Elisha."

     Then after relating the miracle as above quoted by Justin Martyr,
     IrenÃ¦us proceeds :

     "Thus by action the prophet showed, that the solid [which word seems
     to mean, "enduring, irresistible"] Word of God, which we through
     negligence had lost and could not find, we shall recover through the
     dispensation of the Tree or Wood. For that the axe is in some way a
     figure of the Word of God, St. John the Baptist shows, speaking of
     Him : ;Now also is the axe laid to the root of the trees.'
     And Jeremiah in like manner says, ;The Word of the Lord is an
     axe cleaving a rock^34.' Him, then, before hidden from us, the
     dispensation of the Tree or Wood hath now manifested. For since by
     the tree we lost Him, by the tree again He hath become evident unto
     all ; shewing in Himself the length, and height, and depth, and
     breadth; and as one of our elders said, by the divine extension of
     His Hands, gathering the two peoples unto one God. For the Hands are
     two, because there are also two peoples, scattered to the ends of
     the earth ; but the Head in the midst is one, because there is one
     God, who is over all, and through all, and in us all."

     (28.) In the other Apostolic Fathers, I do not know that more than
     one instance occurs of the mystical mode of interpretation ; that
     nothing is to be concluded from this omission, inasmuch as we seldom
     or never find either Hermas, Ignatius, or Polycarp, quoting the Old
     Testament at all. St. Hermas indeed hardly quotes the New, perhaps
     because the parabolical air of his treatise was better preserved by
     avoiding such definite allusions ; or because (which seems not
     improbable) the sacred Books, many of them, had not yet come into
     his hands. And of the other two venerable Saints, it may be observed
     in general, that in no part of their writings had they occasion to
     enter into debate, either with Jews, or with impugners of the Old
     Testament ; which two controversies generally called forth the
     mystical principle of interpretation in the subsequent age.

     But in the epistle of St. Clement there is a well-known passage,
     which proves that by him, at least, that mode of exposition was
     neither unknown nor disapproved. Having related the history of the
     harlot Rahab, as an argument of God's blessing on faith as
     shown by hospitality, he proceeds^35 : "They went on to give her a
     sign, viz. that she should hang a scarlet thread from her house ;
     foretokening this, that by the blood of the Lord shall be redemption
     to all who believe and hope in God. Behold, my beloved : not only
     faith, but prophecy was in this woman." As if he had said, "It was
     not a simple case of an individual sinner of the Gentiles preserved
     by faith ; but God so highly favoured her, as to make her person and
     history a prophecy by action, of the salvation, which should be by
     the Cross."

     Now this single instance, well considered, appears to bring the
     question of the mystical interpretation, as it were, to a point.
     Here is a writer (one is more than half afraid to speak in such a
     tone of one who came so very near the Apostles, but, if we must so
     speak of him, here is a writer) of the very highest human claims ;
     the chosen, ordained friend of St. Paul and St. Peter ; a person of
     the greatest practical good sense, as every part of his epistle
     shows ; full of deep piety, and reverence for the holy Scriptures of
     God ; of a flowing style, and abundant in resources both of imagery
     and of language, so that he was not under the temptation, which an
     ordinary writer might feel, of inserting such topics as happened to
     present themselves, whether satisfied with them himself or no :
     moreover he was evidently not carried away by a passion for
     allegorical interpretation as such, as is proved by the fact that
     this of Rahab is the solitary instance in which he employs it. Now,
     can we believe that such a person, so circumstanced, writing in the
     most solemn way on the most sacred of all subjects, and on an
     occasion which must have recalled most forcibly the memory of St.
     Paul, his father in the faith, not long since dead :---can we
     believe that be could have delivered such an exposition, and applied
     to it the sacred name of Prophecy, publicly and authoritatively,
     speaking as he did for the Church, and not for himself only
     :---had he not been sure that he was uttering the mind of the
     Holy Ghost ? I much fear that we do but betray our own comparative
     irreverence and indifference towards God's holy and awful
     truth, when we are forward to suspect His favoured and accredited
     servants of such light extemporal dealing with His word. Surely the
     less violent supposition is, that St. Clement knew what he was
     saying, when he thus taught or rather reminded the Church (for he
     speaks not as conveying a new truth, but rather as exemplifying one
     already acknowledged) that the colour of scarlet, providentially
     employed as a token and means of deliverance, was an earnest of the
     Atoning Blood, to be sprinkled, like that of the Paschal Lamb, over
     the door-ways of those who should be heirs of salvation. Whereby he
     has also confirmed the analogous interpretation of those places,
     where scarlet is enjoined as the colour to be used in sprinkling and
     other legal purgations ; and has sanctioned the notion of the many
     subsequent writers, by whom that colour, whether found in Scripture
     or in nature, is constantly regarded as o Â¢ i k e i o n (to speak
     rhetorically) to the Passion of our Lord : as much intended among
     colours to symbolize His Blood, as the shape of the Cross among
     forms, or its material, wood, among substances.

     Whatever warrant he had for saying what he has said of the call of
     Rahab, the same, or like it, Tertullian (e. g.) may have had, for
     referring the text in Isaiah^36,---"Though your sins be as
     scarlet, they shall be white as snow : though they be red like
     crimson, they shall be as wool ;"---to the different degrees of
     guilt incurred by the Jews, first as murderers of the prophets,
     afterwards as crucifiers of our Lord. "The word crimson," says he,
     "denotes the blood of the Prophets ; scarlet, that of the Lord, as
     excelling in lustre." IrenÃ¦us again, mixing up his commentary with
     thoughts yet more awful^37 ; "Rahab the harlot, condemning herself
     as a heathen guilty of all kinds of sin, received and hid within her
     home" (he does not say two, but three spies or watchers) "the Three
     Explorers who were exploring the whole earth, the Father namely, and
     the Son, with the Holy Ghost." Which words are not to be so
     understood, as if IrenÃ¦us were affirming the Three Divine Persons
     to have then revealed themselves visibly and personally ; since it
     is a material part of the main argument of his work, to show that
     all visible manifestations of the Eternal Father, in the times of
     the Old Testament, were made through the only-begotten Son : but he
     means, apparently, that Rahab and those like her, receiving those
     who come in God's Name, do in fact receive Him. He goes on with
     the history of Rahab :

     "When the whole city where she dwelt had fallen into ruin at the
     sound of the seven trumpets, in that extremity Rahab the harlot was
     preserved with her whole house, by the faith implied in that sign of
     the scarlet thread : even as the Lord declared to those who would
     not receive His Advent, to the Pharisees, and such as make light of
     the sign of the scarlet robe, which was also a token of the
     Passover, the redemption and withdrawing of the people from
     Egypt,---to the despisers thereof, I say, the Lord declared,
     ;The publicans and harlots take place of you in the Kingdom of
     Heaven.'"

     And Justin, in like manner; adding a remark, that the messengers
     were sent by Him who bore the Name of Jesus^38 :

     "The symbol of the scarlet line denoted the token of Christ's
     Blood, whereby men of all nations, formerly impure and unjust, are
     saved, receiving remission of sins, and sinning no more."

     On this whole history we may remark, as on that of Jacob before,
     that it bears on a critical point in the progress of the great
     dispensation, and on the continuation of the sacred line in which
     Christ was to be born. Also, that each of the successive writers
     (and the chain might be continued much further) notices, not
     ambitiously but naturally, some circumstance unobserved by his
     predecessors ; so that the whole, taken together, forms an allegory
     much more complete and striking, than we find in either of the
     statements taken singly. Dare any man deny that these are great
     marks of Truth, even according to our modern measures, incompetent
     as they obviously are to these investigations?

     (29.) We have thus endeavoured to trace one set of mystical
     allusions, those, namely, which are drawn from the circumstances of
     our Lord's Passion, through the interpretations of the Old
     Testament, left us by the Apostolic Fathers ; and also to illustrate
     them from the Fathers of the next generation, so far as to give some
     idea of the kind of consent, in their mode of expounding, which is
     found among them all : an agreement not in minute particulars, as if
     they borrowed from one another, nor yet as if they were bound down
     in common by any Strict ritual, or hieroglyphical alphabet ; but
     rather in a way which cannot, perhaps, be better expressed, than in
     the words of St. Augustine^39, where he lays down the principle
     which guided him in the investigation of historical types. "These
     secrets of Divine Scripture we trace out, as we may, one more or
     less aptly than another, but as becomes faithful men, holding thus
     much for certain ; that not without some kind of foreshadowing of
     future events, were these done and recorded ; and that to Christ
     only, and His Church the City of God, are they to be referred in
     every instance," so far as they are figurative.

     On the true cause of this very general agreement, some
     considerations will be offered hereafter, which may at least have
     the effect of helping us all to think with seriousness of heart, on
     a subject, which scholars in general have, perhaps, been apt to
     treat over-lightly, not to say profanely ; so that, in speaking of
     it, a person insensibly falls into the apologetic tone. But the more
     we really come to know and think of it, the more deeply, perhaps,
     shall we feel, that even that tone is inexcusable presumption,
     compared with what would become us, in making mention of those who
     come nearest the Apostles, and had in greatest perfection the mind
     of Christ.

     Â§iii.-The Literal Sense left entire by the Mysticism of the Church.

     No impression, I believe, is more general among ordinary readers of
     theology, than this; that beyond a strong tendency to allegory, the
     Fathers had no definite principles at all, by which to interpret
     Scripture, but only employed, in a rhetorical way, whatever
     allusions best served the purpose of the moment. A remarkable and
     not a very encouraging fact, if such really were the case, that such
     a series of distinguished writers,---writers whom their very
     censurers^40 allow to have greatly exceeded the mass of their
     contemporaries,---zealously applying themselves to this one work,
     and with a, devotion and reverence as sincere, in very many cases,
     as martyrdom could prove it; that these should have gone on quite at
     random, and have been right, when they were right, only by a happy
     chance. Nor would it seem easy to reconcile such a statement with
     our Lord's command to search the Scriptures, and with His
     implied and express promises of spiritual aid ; unless we were
     prepared to maintain, what all history contradicts, that the Fathers
     either neglected the Bible, or forfeited the promise of aid in the
     study of it by gross heresy, or insincerity, proved, by ill conduct.

     But is the fact so, that they were without principles of
     interpretation? Is it not rather our want of steady attention and
     reverential industry in examining the whole subject, which makes it
     seem so to us? It is readily allowed, that there exists a peculiar
     difficulty, in evolving the patristical rules for expounding
     Scripture, on which difficulty something will be presently said. But
     that some such principles, however latent, do exist, we might
     confidently gather from this one fact ; that no one, tolerably
     versed in their writings, would fail to detect their style of
     interpretation, wherever he met with it, by something in its, air
     and tone ; something, not the less real, because it may be to us
     indescribable in words. Let anyone, for example, compare the
     commentary of Quesnel on the New Testament, or that of Wogan on the
     Proper Lessons, both which are expressly, founded on the ancient
     glosses, with the explanations of Scripture interspersed in the
     "Pilgrim's Progress." Both being to a high degree allegorical,
     he will yet find the one, throughout of a different caste and family
     from the other.

     (2.) Now it is no wonder if we find it difficult to seize in
     distinct thought, and embody in language, the exegetic principles of
     the old Church writers since, in all probability few, if any, of
     them were ever able to do so for themselves. With an instinctive
     skill, acquired in part at least, by long and zealous training of
     themselves in that one department, they felt when any exposition or
     conjecture, which occurred to them, was (to use their own word)
     Ecclesiastical, and when otherwise. It was a happy sagacity, which
     could afford to dispense with all manner of critical and
     argumentative development. They were natives, and could speak the
     language idiomatically, without stopping to recollect rules of
     grammar.

     And here we seem to have no inconsiderable proof, that the mystical
     interpretation was no result of a theory subsequently introduced
     among Christians ; it was not this or that writer's importation
     or invention, but it was from the beginning habitually inwrought
     into the thoughts and language of the Catholic Church.

     Hereby also we have suggested to us a way for attaining to a virtual
     knowledge, of their rules of interpretation, though we perhaps may
     never be able, any more than they were, to trace out those rules in
     language. We have only to exercise ourselves much and deeply in
     their expositions of Holy Writ, and in the observances which we know
     they kept up, and we by degrees their practised eye---e Â¢ x e Â¢
     m p e i r Ãa z Ã³m m a ---whereby to discern their first
     principles. This would be one way, and on every account the best
     way, of convincing ourselves that the mysticism of the early
     interpreters is not the vague, unsettled, dreamy kind of view, which
     many of us are at first hearing apt to imagine. We may set ourselves
     to study the examples of it thoroughly in detail: and finding, as we
     shall in a great proportion of them, a great deal more than we had
     expected, we shall gradually and surely learn, both to value the
     method more highly, and to understand it better.

     (3.) With this view, some examples have been given above: examples
     purposely selected, many of them, as the likeliest to startle and
     scandalize a mere modern reader ; and something, it is hoped, has
     been done towards shewing, that in those cases at least the holy
     Fathers well knew what they were about ; that they proceeded, in
     interpreting Scripture, on the surest ground---the warrant of
     Scripture itself in analogous cases.

     Another process, leading to the same conclusion, would be to
     examine, fairly and fully, whether there be not certain limitations
     which the Fathers carefully observe in their application of the
     mystical method ; certain bounds within which they confine
     themselves, as did champions of old within the rules of the tourney,
     in the utmost heat and speed of their career. Some indeed of these
     rules are laid down in express words by the more exact and
     argumentative of the Fathers : others we may gather with sufficient
     assurance from the comparison of their comments. To this subject,
     then, the limitations of the mystical exposition, as they were
     generally recognized by Antiquity, we are to address ourselves in
     the present stage of the inquiry.

     (4.) The first and most obvious of these rules of limitation was,
     not to lose sight of the letter; to reserve in every mystical
     comment the foundation of historical and literal truth. This, as all
     men know, is one of the points on which the Fathers have been most
     confidently assailed ; but, as a few plain considerations will show,
     most unjustly.

     For, first, the evidences of the Christian religion were from the
     beginning chiefly historical : such as the records of the life of
     Christ, the ministration of the Apostles, and the facts by which, in
     the old dispensation, God had authorized His messages by His
     prophets. The faith had been received in the first instance, as to
     the main body of it, in the plain literal and historical sense. It
     was so accepted by the mass of believers, as the Old Testament had
     ever been by the mass of the Jews ; and surely appeal might be made
     without hesitation to those who are really versed in Christian
     Antiquity, whether even the most daring mystics among them do not
     all along assume the truth of the history ; whether the mere
     allegory, which they sometimes appear to maintain, be at worst more
     than an exception to a general law; a resort in difficulties ; a
     solecism, not a rule.

     (5.) But secondly, if in any case they seem to press the allegory
     beyond this, there are considerations, which would lead a sound
     critic to be cautious in urging their statements in that kind
     further than, their very words oblige us to go. There are reasons
     which should induce us to give them all the benefit of any
     qualification or ambiguity which their expressions admit of, -to
     construe all that is equivocal in favour of the literal meaning.
     Were they not in a great measure free from some of the temptations,
     which have ever been found most effective, in inducing inconsiderate
     commentators to deal over freely with the letter of the Divine
     Records? These temptations have commonly arisen, on the one hand,
     from over refinement in philosophical and moral subjects ; on the
     other hand, from critical skill, and dexterity in sifting statements
     on matters of fact. Of the first head, philosophical and moral
     allegory, something will be said by-and-by, when, we come to the
     case of those Fathers, who are allowed to have erred in exaggerating
     the mystical sense. But their general deficiency in critical and
     historical acuteness is notoriously one of the most popular charges
     against them, and one of the reasons most frequently given for not
     deferring to their authority in Scripture interpretation. Those who
     judge so of them, must at least allow that they were, so far, exempt
     from that temptation to take liberties with the text of Scripture,
     which historical and critical difficulties continually offer.

     For example, had Origen been as unversed in critical discussion, as
     were, on, this hypothesis, the majority of the Fathers, be would not
     have been driven, by a supposed chronological difficulty, to throw
     discredit generally on the letter of the evangelical narrative. So
     at least he is supposed to have done, in commenting on St.
     John's account of our Saviour's return to Galilee after
     the temptation. Not finding how to reconcile that account with those
     of the other Evangelists, he says^41, (if his words indeed are
     rightly so translated,) "The truth concerning these things must
     needs be lodged out of sight in their secondary and, spiritual
     signification. The discrepancy being so accounted for, we need not
     relax in any measure our faith regarding the Gospel narratives, as
     though they were either untrue, or destitute of any peculiar divine
     inspiration, or failing in their proper office as memorial's."
     Then having, stated the difficulty at length, he concludes, "In this
     and many cases besides, whoever will carefully examine the Gospels
     with a view to any disagreement in the narrative, it will either
     cause him with a sort of mental giddiness to give up the claim of
     the Gospels to absolute authority and choose one of them at random
     to adhere to, as not venturing to repudiate entirely the faith of
     our, Lord ; or, if he still admit all four, he will consider their
     truth to be lodged somewhere else, than in the outward material
     words, and letters, and syllables." The amount of Origen's
     meaning in this passage may perhaps be a subject of discussion
     by-and-by. At present it is quoted simply for the sake of pointing
     out the danger incurred by habits of searching criticism, viz. that,
     it leads men, on discovering flaws, to them, incurable, to think
     more slightly, than they ought of the letter of the Bible
     altogether. It is the genius of modern philology, to cut all such
     knots, by expressing or insinuating more or less of doubt, as to the
     plenary inspiration of the Scriptures. Some of the ancients, not
     perhaps more logically, but with at least as much of religious awe
     and reverence, had recourse, we see, in the like cases, to the
     suppositions of mere allegory intermixed with the truth. But the far
     greater number of theme being, as their opponents complain, quite
     "uncritical," i. e. taking the text as they found it, and not
     perplexing themselves with difficulties of construction and,
     harmony, were free at least from this one undue bias towards the
     secondary sense.

     (6.) A still stronger and more universal preservative must have been
     the unfeigned and singular veneration, with which they ever regarded
     the Holy Book. Whatever else may be laid to the Fathers'
     charge, even the most scornful and bitter of their censors have been
     constrained to admit the paramount value which they set on their
     Bibles, and, their thorough acquaintance with them. Even where they
     mysticised improperly, their ordinary motive was a sincere
     veneration for the Scriptures ; whose dignity, they sometimes with
     some plausibility argued, could not stand with the literal sense.
     This was a shortsighted and erroneous feeling, so far as it may have
     wanted that wise and simple faith, which would have caused them at
     once to receive the very letter, hoping or pretending to explain all
     difficulties. Still there was a feeling here of affectionate and
     dutiful though mistaken loyalty; like St. Peter's, when lie
     took hold of our Lord and began rebuke and contradict Him ; saying,
     "Be it far from this shall not be unto Thee."

     Accordingly, when Origen goes off to the mystical sense, it is with
     him almost always a matter of reverent and earnest prayer.

     Thus, having given a careful and sensible commentary on literal
     account in Genesis of the building of the ark, he proceeds^42 :

     "Now, first beseeching His indulgence, who alone is able to withdraw
     the veil from the reading of the Old Testament, let us try and make
     out what spiritual edification also is contained in the raising of
     this august fabric, the ark."

     Again in his exposition of the parable of the unmerciful servant^43
     :

     "It is no small matter to express, according to the full meaning of
     our Saviour, who are meant by the various persons introduced in this
     parable : . . . indeed, the very truth of these things, I am bold to
     affirm, no one shall be able to utter, unless the same Jesus, who
     privately expounded these things to His own disciples, have entered
     in to dwell in his mind, and open there all the treasures contained
     in the parable ; dark, hidden, far out of sight. I for my
     part,---as one who has not yet obtained in sufficiency that mind,
     which can thoroughly penetrate and mingle with the mind of Christ,
     that mind, which, aided by the Spirit, can search all, even the
     depths of God-am able as yet to form but an indefinite notion of the
     details of this passage."

     The expression of awe is, perhaps, still more remarkable, wen he
     draws back from an interpretation, which he had actually entered on:
     as one who caught himself unawares intruding further into the
     sanctuary than he had intended. It is on the Parable of the
     Labourers in the Vineyard^44, he says :

     "Seeking out, what might be the ;one day,' which limits
     the time of this parable, I have unwarily taken some steps into
     certain of the deeps of Almighty God ; lacking as I do that Spirit
     which searcheth all things, even the deep things of God."

     Surely the tone of mind here apparent could not exist, without a
     profound veneration for the letter itself and literal meaning, the
     garb and outward vehicle of truths so revered and precious. Surely
     it could have been only by comparison, if ever, the same writers
     seem to disparage the letter. And in fact we find that few authors
     have done more for the elucidation of the historical sense, or given
     more unsparingly the best practical proof of reverence, unwearied
     religious diligence in trying to understand. So that with respect to
     the threefold method of interpretation, which he is known to have
     generally adopted, a partial judge might almost say of him, and of
     others like him, as contrasted with modern that he had three Bibles
     to read and we but one ; a jot or tittle failing in his reverence
     for the body of the sacred Book, compared with ours, while he
     enjoys, what we generally want, the privilege of contemplating its
     soul and spirit also.

     (7.) Now, if even Origen, the known champion of the allegorical
     method, felt and practised such regard for the Letter of Scripture,
     it is surely unnecessary to multiply quotations, in proof of the
     opinion of the Church on that subject : her impartial veneration for
     the whole of the Divine Book, her deep, faithful and undoubting
     reception of every part, both in its, obvious and in its abstract
     senses, according to the fullness of the meaning of the Spirit of
     God. There, is a striking passage in St. Augustine, which collects,
     as it were, into a point, the confessions on this head of every
     generation of believers^45.

     "The style itself in which Holy Scripture is framed, how open is it
     to everyone's approach, how impossible to be searched out by
     any, but a very few! What things it contains that are obvious and
     open, those, like a familiar friend, it speaks simply to the heart,
     both of unlearned and learned. As to those, on the other band, which
     it hides in mysteries, neither does it elevate them by lofty speech,
     such as might deter from a nearer approach the dull and untaught
     mind, as a poor man sometimes fears to approach a rich one ; but
     Scripture invites all by a lowly kind of speech, intending only to
     feed all with obvious truth, but also to exercise and prove all by
     that truth which is remote from view : having in its easy parts
     whatever its hard parts contain. But lest, being open to view, they
     should incur contempt, the same truths again are made desirable by
     concealment; to meet the desire, they are, as it were, produced
     anew; and being so renewed, they insinuate themselves with a kind of
     delight. Thus wholesome correction is provided for corrupt minds,
     wholesome nourishment for feeble minds, and wholesome enjoyment for
     great minds. That mind alone is set against this teaching, which
     either through error knows not its healing power, or through
     sickness loathes it as medicine."

     Men who were so minded towards the whole Book of God,---would it
     not require overpowering evidence to convince us that they commonly
     passed by with disdain the letter of Scripture? Yet they have been
     charged with no less than this.

     (8.) The improbability of such allegations becomes yet more glaring
     when we take into account the universal cast and tenour of the
     Fathers' doctrinal views. This is a consideration, indirectly
     indeed, yet really and materially, bearing on the present
     discussion. Ever since the Church began, she has felt that she had
     to guard against a tendency to over-refinement and affected
     spirituality. There has been danger lest the body, so to call it, of
     important truths should be exhausted and exhaled away, in their
     supposed moral and imaginative meaning. This is the error of the
     people called Friends, and in general of the rationalists of modern
     days. It was also the error of the Gnostics of old, who denied, as
     is well known, the reality of the Incarnation and Passion of our
     Lord, the Resurrection of the Body, the identity of the Creator with
     the Redeemer ; and whatever other portions of Christian belief
     appeared to them in any way mixed up with things outward, material,
     and bodily. Against there, in the beginning as now, the Church of
     God always protested, maintaining the literal reality of these
     Truths, as she now maintains the real efficacy of material
     Sacraments, in opposition to the refinements of philosophy and vain
     deceit. Now it was a sort of index to this first school, their
     denying the historical meaning of Holy Scripture; as may be seen in
     many parts of IrenÃ¦us. His statements are like the followings^46:

     "These vainest of sophists maintain that the Apostles taught not
     truly but feignedly, according to the capacity of their hearers ;
     that they framed their answers to suit the prejudices of those who
     at any time were asking them questions ; discoursing with the blind
     blindly, according to their blindness, and with the sick according
     to their sickness, and the erring according to their error. Thus, to
     such as imagined that the Creator was the only God, they made Him
     the subject of their preaching ; but to those who are able to
     receive the unutterable Father, they administered by parables and
     allegories the unspeakable mystery : thus making it out that our
     Lord and His Apostles gave instruction, not according to the tenor
     of the very truth, but in pretence, and according to the capacity of
     each."

     Such are the complaints brought against heretical theorists, by
     ecclesiastic writers of those days. Had we no direct evidence on the
     subject, passages of this sort would warrant us in concluding, that
     the early Church held to the literal Scripture as her foundation,
     whatever the superstructure of mystical or moral truth she might
     know and believe herself entitled to build upon it. For there is a
     natural and very distinct analogy between the doctrines, which
     reject the body, and the expositions, which reject the letter. We
     perceive at once that they belong in their several kinds to the same
     turn of mind, the same school of opinions. And on the other hand,
     the straightforward, unflinching faith, which is always content to
     take God's work as He has made it, will of course be willing
     also to accept His Word as He has taught it. "When I hear of grass,"
     says St. Basil^47, remarking on the excessive proneness to the mere
     allegory, by which some had explained away the history in the first
     chapter of Genesis, "when I hear of grass, I understand it to mean
     grass, and so of plants and fishes, and beasts, and cattle ; all of
     them, as they are spoken, so I receive. For neither am I ashamed of
     the Gospel." And a little further on :

     "In the oracles of the Spirit, I desire to glorify Him, who has not
     employed our understanding on vain things, but has dispensed all so
     as to be written for our edification, and the perfecting of our
     souls. Of which truth, as I think, some not being aware, have tried,
     by I know not what allurements and figures of speech, to get the
     Scriptures credit for a kind of dignity, which in fact is of their
     own devising. But this is to make one's self wiser than the
     oracles of the Spirit, and under the show of interpretation,
     covertly to introduce matter of our own. As it is written then, so
     let our understanding be."

     (9.) There occurs however in the history of early corruptions one
     case, which would appear at first sight to militate strongly against
     the reality of the connection here supposed, between fantastic
     doctrine and interpretation merely allegorical. I mean the case of
     Marcion of Pontus. He distinguished himself from the main body of
     the heretics of his time, by denying that Scripture was ever to be
     understood in any sense but that of the bare letter : at the same
     time that he agreed with them in rejecting the truth of
     Christ's Body, the resurrection of our bodies, and the other
     doctrines above alluded to.

     But see what line Marcion was obliged to take, in consequence of
     this extraordinary combination of opinions. He boldly discarded the
     whole of the Old Testament, as the work of an evil, at least of an
     inferior being. He retained, moreover, of New Testament only one
     Gospel, St. Luke's, and the Epistles of St. Paul. And, to make
     these at all seem to bear witness in his favour, he was constrained
     to dislocate and alter the text to a very considerable extent.

     It is not within our present scope to show how inconsistent, after
     all, his admitted Scriptures were with his shadows of doctrine :
     Tertullian has done so at large, and with more, if possible, than
     his usual acuteness, in his two last books against Marcion : but the
     point material to be here noticed is, his sympathizing with the
     other heretics, and contradicting the Catholic Church, in his
     irreverence for the letter of Scripture : the only differences
     being, that he chose rather to take the ground of the Jews of his
     time, and, in effect, that of our modern rationalists, by denying
     the inspiration of the portions which most perplexed him ; instead
     of wresting them, as most heretics did, by various figures, to his
     own construction.

     Thus it appears that the proceedings of Marcion form no such
     exception as should invalidate the general rule ; and the position
     stands good, that the Church of the Fathers, maintaining as it did
     the doctrines which the DocetÃ¦ denied, was very unlikely to give
     undue sanction to their merely allegorical mode of interpreting
     Scripture ; just as the same Church, even yet, arguing with
     rationalists, refuses to admit that "fire in the prophecy of St.
     John the Baptist is quenched with, the name of the Holy Ghost, or
     with the name of the Spirit, water dried up in the words of
     Christ"^48, concerning the new birth.

     (10.) The drift of all these antecedent probabilities is this: that
     whatever affirmations are found in ecclesiastical writers strongly
     in favour of the letter of holy Scripture, are to be credited for
     their full apparent amount ; but for those comparatively rare
     instances, in which they have permitted themselves to speak lightly
     of the literal meaning, every kind of allowance ought to be made;
     they must be taken, so to speak, at a considerable discount.
     Consider, for example, the opening sentences of St. Augustine's
     treatise, De Genesi ad literam^49. "The whole Scripture of God is
     twofold; according to the intimation of our Lord, when He said,
     ;Every scribe instructed into the kingdom of heaven is like
     unto a man that is an householder, bringing out of his treasure
     things new and old.' . . . . In the relation therefore of
     things done, one has always to inquire whether each particular is to
     be received in the figurative, sense only, or to be affirmed and
     maintained as to the actual verity of the facts. For to deny that
     there are things to be figuratively understood no Christian man will
     venture, remarking the words of the Apostle, ;All these things
     befell them in figure ;' as also where he commends to us, as a
     great mystery relating to Christ and the Church, the expression in
     Genesis, ;And they two shall be one flesh.'"

     This place has been quoted^50 as an instance of extravagance in
     urging the secondary sense, on account, probably, of the possibility
     intimated in one part of it, that in some cases there may be no true
     literal or historical sense. But, according to the rule above laid
     down for interpreting the Fathers on this subject, it is but fair to
     understand by St, Augustine's doubtful cases, those which may
     reasonably be considered more or less parabolical ; such as
     Nathan's reproof of David, or our Lord's account of the
     Prodigal Son. It would be doing him injustice, to charge him with
     throwing doubt hereby on any part of the series of sacred history.

     On the other hand, when we find the same Father arguing as follows
     in favour of the reality of Paradise, and of the history of our
     first parents, we need not hesitate to believe, that he meant his
     argument to extend, as by parity of reasoning it would extend, to
     every other portion of the regular inspired narrative. He says^51:

     Those of our faith, who believe these divine books but like not to
     have Paradise understood according to the very letter, i. e. a most
     pleasant place, shaded with groves of fruit trees, of immense
     extent, too, and fertilized by a copious fountain; seeing as they
     do, without any labour of man, so many green glades overshadowed
     with forests by the secret working of the Almighty :---I wonder
     how they believe the corresponding narrative of the formation of the
     man, in a way like nothing which ever met their eyes. Or if that,
     too, must be understood figuratively ; who begat Cain, Abel, and
     Seth? Were they likewise mere figures, not men born of mankind? I
     would advise men therefore, narrowly to consider what is the drift
     of the notion they are inclined to assume, and to endeavour with us
     to understand all things, related as facts in the first instance, as
     they are literally expressed. That once done, every one will look
     kindly on their views of what the same things teach also by
     figurative expression, either of spiritual natures themselves and
     spiritual processes, or of events yet to come.

     I grant that if we could not receive in a bodily sense the things
     here named as bodily, without doing violence to the faith of the
     truth, nothing would remain but that we must understand them to be
     figurative expressions, rather than cast impious reflections on Holy
     Scripture. But if the bodily acceptation of these things be so far
     from embarrassing, that it rather more firmly establishes, the
     general statements of God's word, I should not expect to find
     any one so full of heathenish obstenacy, as to abide by any old
     opinion, which he may have formed in favor of the mere allegorical
     exposition, after seeing the whole explained literally in accordance
     with the Rule of Faith.

     He then proceeds to state, as the very occasion of his writing that
     treatise, a wish to improve on a former exposition of Genesis, which
     he had undertaken against the ManichÃ¦ans ; and in which, not being
     able at that time to make out the literal meaning, he had assigned
     to many things an interpretation merely allegorical^52. He says:

     "Still even then, keeping in mind that which was all along chiefly
     in my wish though beyond my power, vis. that every thing in the
     first instance should be understood not in figure but literally, and
     not despairing altogether that such an understanding might be
     acquired, I expressed that feeling in the opening of the second
     book. My words are, ;Whosoever desires to understand every
     thing, according to the sound of the letter, provided he can avoid
     blasphemies, and all that he affirms be agreeable to the Catholic
     Faith, his labours must not be taken grudgingly : rather we must
     account of him as understanding the Scriptures in the proper sense
     of the word, understanding.'"

     That such from the beginning was St. Augustine's
     feeling,---that he always preferred the literal sense as the
     foundation, and only had recourse to the purely figurative, when, as
     he conceived, the analogy of the faith required it,---he gave the
     most satisfactory proof, by going over the same ground, writing a
     more literal commentary, when in process of time maturer reflection
     had brought to his knowledge more of the literal meaning.

     (11.) I say, when the analogy of the faith required it ; for this is
     a very remarkable circumstance in the patristical mode of deviating
     from the letter of Scripture, especially as compared with those
     adopted by more modern interpreters : viz. that whereas these latter
     are commonly moved to set it aside by some apparent inconsistency
     with the truths of philosophy or history, some scruple of human
     reason ; the only sufficient plea for such deviation, in the
     judgment of such critics as St. Augustine, was the impossibility of
     reconciling the letter with the Rule of Faith. Thus, in the, passage
     quoted above, the excepted cases are described as follows: "Si nullo
     modo possent salve fide veritatis corporaliter accipi :" "Si nullus
     exitus datur, ut pie et digne Deo quÃ¦ scripta sunt intelligantur,
     nisi figurate proposita credamus." And let it, not be imagined that
     by the phrase, "pie et digne Deo," a door, is opened for the
     unlimited intrusion of each person's private judgement. The
     phrase is sufficiently explained by one which had occurred a few
     lines above : "prÃ¦dicare omnia congruentia fidei catholicÃ¦." That
     was to be judged pious and worthy of God, which agreed, not with
     this or that man's preconceived notions of the divine
     proceedings and attributes, but with the body of scriptural truth
     set forth by the Church from the beginning.

     If, then, we may suppose St. Augustine here to speak the general
     sense of ecclesiastical writers on this subject, we shall see that
     the utmost extent, to which the Church encouraged the use of the
     exposition by mere allegory, was to bear with it as a possible or at
     most as a probable hypothesis, in cases where the letter seemed
     irreconcileable with the analogy of the Faith ; always allowing for
     the chance of some more favoured commentator solving the difficulty
     without this extreme resort.

     (12.) But the true ecclesiastical rule of interpretation will be put
     in a stronger light, if we consider the case of Origen and his
     school, and the degree in which they incurred the suspicion, if not
     the censure, of the Church. And we may notice, by the way, a
     remarkable instance of the hard measure which has been dealt out to
     the Fathers, by those who were resolved, at all events, for whatever
     reason, to derogate from their authority. It is the usual manner of
     proceeding, with such writers as DaillÃ©, Whitby, Middleton, and the
     rest, to quote largely from the censures of St. Jerome and others,
     pronounced on the Origenists for their extravagance in the
     allegorical way, and then to turn suddenly round, and use these same
     censures, as if they were applicable to the whole body of the
     Fathers ; especially to St. Jerome himself and the rest who were
     eager in promulgating them.

     But surely the censure might speak the opinion of the Church,
     though, from human infirmity and inconsistency, the persons
     pronouncing it might themselves incur it elsewhere.

     Again, it should be well considered whether St. Jerome, St. Basil,
     and others, commonly quoted on this matter, are deprecating the
     allegorical system itself, or only the particular abuse of it now
     under examination, viz. the occasional suppression of the letter for
     the allegory's sake. It may be some help towards estimating
     rightly the judgment of the Fathers on the whole subject, if a few
     words be here added, first on the real amount of the concessions of
     the Alexandrian school in disparagement of the letter ; next on the
     real amount of Church censure, properly so called, which that school
     incurred, on that ground, in the person of Origen, the most
     renowned, and therefore perhaps the most obnoxious, of all its
     champions.

     (13.) And first, as to the extent of liberty taken by Origen with
     the literal sense of the Bible: it is but just to begin with
     stating, that his faith in the plenary inspiration of Holy Writ,
     those parts of it even which he is most accused of denying, is as
     unquestionable as it can be rendered, both by the tone of cordial
     reverence in every part, and also by repeated glowing professions
     like the following^53 :

     By this brief demonstration of the divinity of Jesus, and
     application of the prophetical words concerning Him, we do in effect
     demonstrate at the same time the Divine inspiration of the
     Scriptures which prophesy of Him, and also of the writings which
     relate His sojourn here and His teaching ; writings, which were
     uttered with all authority and power, and have thereby become
     victorious over the elect portion of the Gentiles. It should be
     added that the divinity of the prophetic words, and the spirituality
     of Moses' laws shone forth only in consequence of the [earthly]
     sojourn of Jesus. For evident proofs of the inspiration of the
     ancient Scriptures, before Christ's sojourn here, it was not
     possible to exhibit ; but the Law and the Prophets, before liable to
     suspicion, whether they were indeed things Divine, had a clear light
     cast on them by the residence of Jesus on earth, as being composed
     and written by a grace from above. And he who with care and
     attention studies the prophetic words, feeling as he will on the
     bare reading a kind of enthusiasm stealing over him, will be
     convinced by his feelings that they are no writings of men, which we
     believe to be the words of God. The light, too, which existed before
     in the Law of Moses, wrapped up in a veil, shone forth at the time
     of our Lord's abode here; the veil being taken away, and the
     good things, which were shadowed by the letter, coming gradually
     into full knowledge.

     (14.) Next, I observe, that in general, i. e. with comparatively few
     exceptions, and those always particularly accounted for, Origen did
     not only receive the letter, but acknowledge the historical meaning,
     of the Holy Book. This will be sufficiently evident by a few
     citations, falling into two separate groupes. The first will consist
     of passages in which he inculcates his much canvassed maxim of a
     Triple Sense of Scripture : the other, of express or incidental
     cautions, in the course of his commentary, over and over enforced
     upon his hearers, not to lose sight of the letter in the brightness
     of the Spirit.

     The Triple Sense of Scripture is most expressly set forth in a
     well-known passage of the Fourth Book p e r Ã¬Â¢ a r c v n ^54.

     "We ought to transcribe into our own souls the meaning of the Holy
     Writings in three several ways : in the first place, that the
     simpler may be edified by what may be called flesh or body of the
     Scripture, by which name we denote the obvious, literal acceptation
     : in the next place, that he who has attained to a certain height,
     may receive edification from that which is as it were the soul of
     the same Scripture : thirdly, that he who is perfect, and like those
     of whom the Apostle speaks as fit to have wisdom spoken among
     them---wisdom not of this world---that they too may be edified
     out of that spiritual law, which has the shadow of good things to
     come. For as man is compounded of body, and soul, and Spirit, so is
     the Scripture, dispensed by God by way of gift for the salvation of
     men."

     Again, in a noble passage of the Fifth Homily on
     Leviticus^55,---which may be cited the more at length, on account
     of the light, which it seems to throw on the analogy above alleged,
     as existing between the doctrines of the Fathers and heretics
     respectively, and their methods of interpreting Scripture. He
     observes:

     "The details of the law concerning sacrifices are to be received in
     a different sense from that which the literal text points out. Else,
     when they are publicly read in the Church, they tend rather to the
     hindrance and subversion of the Christian faith, than to the
     admonition and edification of men. But if we search and find in what
     sense these things are said, and mark them, as they ought who think
     of God, who is the declared author of these laws ; then the hearer
     will become a Jew indeed, but ;a Jew inwardly,' according
     to the distinction of St. Paul in the Epistle to the Romans; which
     distinction of the inward and outward Jew, certain impious heretics
     not understanding, have withdrawn themselves not from the Scriptures
     only, but from God also, the Giver of this law and of the divine
     Scriptures to mankind, and have feigned to themselves another god,
     besides the Maker of Heaven and Earth : whereas, as you know, the
     verity of the faith holds one and the same God of the Law and of the
     Gospel, the Creator alike of visible and invisible things: the
     rather, because the things visible retain with invisible no small
     affinity ; so that the Apostle affirms, ;the invisible things
     of God, from the creation of the world,' to be seen,
     ;being understood by the things which are made.' As
     therefore a mutual affinity exists between things visible and
     invisible, earth and heaven, soul and flesh, body and spirit, and of
     combinations of these is made up this present world : so also Holy
     Scripture, we may believe, is made up of visible and invisible parts
     : first, as it were, of a kind of body i. e. of the letter, which we
     see with our eyes : next of a soul, i. e. of the sense which is
     discovered within that letter : thirdly, of a spirit, so far as it
     contains also in itself certain heavenly things ; as says the
     Apostle, ;they serve to the example and shadow of things
     celestial.'

     "Such then being the case, let us, first calling on God, who made of
     Scripture both the body, and soul, and spirit---the body for
     those who were before us, the soul for ourselves, the spirit for
     those who in time to come shall obtain the inheritance of eternal
     life, whereby to win their way to the heavenly kingdoms ;---let
     us now seek that soul of the law, which I have mentioned, so far as
     belongs to our present subject."

     (15.) One may remark, by the way, that the opening of this statement
     enables us in some measure to solve one principal difficulty
     connected with the allegorical method ; viz. how it came to pass
     that in public and popular discourses, discourses to the unbaptized,
     Origen and others, so continually and unreservedly publish these
     mystical expositions ; expositions which themselves repeatedly
     compare to strong meat, hardly fit therefore for the babes and
     beginners in Christ. This is to be accounted for, probably, much in
     the same manner as the publication of the Three Creeds, and putting
     the mysteries of our faith in every one's mouth ; it was in
     itself not desirable, nay rather contrary to Church principles : but
     the Jews and perverse heretics made it necessary, each endeavouring,
     for their own purposes, to maintain that, the Old Testament was
     contrary to the New : a position which could not in strict reasoning
     be met satisfactorily, unless by divulging the secret of the
     allegorical meaning. Origen himself speaks feelingly of this
     difficulty, in the course of his remarks on the parable of the
     Unmerciful Servant^56.

     "But some one will say, are we not acting irreligiously in wishing
     these things to convey a meaning, because of the heavenly
     Book's secret and mystical nature in some parts? Are we not
     wrong in trying to expound these things? however accurately, for
     argument's sake, we may suppose ourselves to have made out the
     drift of them."

     The tenor of his answer is this : that it was by no means his
     custom, to trust his ordinary hearers with all the mysterious
     wonders, which be seemed to himself faintly to discern in Scripture,
     but that be always suggested those which he judged best for edifying
     : of which edification, one necessary groundwork would be, the
     securing the flock against the prevailing heresies.

     (16.) But to proceed with our reasons for attributing, even to the
     allegorical school, a high respect for the literal sense. Clement of
     Alexandria, Origen's predecessor, in discoursing on the two
     senses (for it does not appear that it had occurred to him to
     distinguish the Moral from the Mystical ; as Origen afterwards did,
     influenced perhaps by a desire to retain together with the Christian
     interpretation as much as he could of the morality which he admired
     in Philo^57 ;) Clement, I say, among other very many passages to the
     same effect, has one in which he refers to a tradition, remarkable
     at least for poetical force and beauty :

     "When God took Moses to Himself, Joshua saw him in two forms ; in
     one with angels, in the other on the mountains and among the ravines
     receiving sepulchral honours. This sight Joshua beheld from above,
     being lifted up in the Spirit, together with Caleb. . . . The drift
     of the history being, I suppose, to show that true knowledge does
     not belong to all, but some behold only the body of the Scriptures,
     the words and sentences, as it were the body of Moses : others see
     through to the meaning and the things signified by the words, making
     that Moses who is with the angels the object of their search. In
     fact, of those who called on the Lord Himself, the greater part said
     only, ;Son of David, have mercy on me ;' but some few
     acknowledged Him to be the Son of God, as Peter ; whom also He
     blessed, because not flesh and blood had revealed to him the truth,
     but His Father, which is in heaven : Christ showed, that the perfect
     Christian recognises the Son of the Almighty, not by the flesh,
     which was conceived born, but by the very power of the Father."

     Such passages as these lose their force, except we understand letter
     of Scripture to have, in the opinion of these writers, substantial
     meaning, as the bodies of our Lord and of Moses were real and
     substantial.

     The same remark may be made on the only place, that I know of, in
     which Clement seems to come near the Origenian doctrine of the three
     significations. "The purport of the law," he says, "we must take,
     either as declaring to us some sign," (i. e. as it may seem, some
     instance of Divine interference,) "or as some commandment for right
     conversation, or as uttering oracle in the manner of a prophecy."
     Here it is plain that the first or historical meaning is by no means
     slighted or annulled, since to it is ascribed the office of
     declaring signs from heaven.

     (17.) We may now proceed to some citations from Origen belonging to
     the second of the two classes specified above : cases, namely, in
     which he warns his hearers, more or less expressly, that the letter
     is by no means abolished. First, there is a remarkable fragment
     produced by the Martyr Pamphilus, which, on the whole, we may cite
     without scruple, notwithstanding the suspicions cast by St. Jerome
     and others, on the good faith or genuineness of the Apology for
     Origen, which went under Pamphilus' name. For it has no
     relation to the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, which was the occasion
     of the corruptions specified by Jerome ; and again, it has all the
     internal evidence, which can arise from agreement with Origen's
     ordinary interpretations. Thus then Pamphilus represents him as
     speaking of the evangelical narrative generally^58.

     "Though these things have a spiritual meaning, yet the truth of the
     history being first established, the spiritual sense is to be taken
     as something over and above. For what if our Lord, in a spiritual
     sense, be always curing the blind, when He casts His light on minds
     blinded with ignorance : yet He did not the less at that time heal
     one corporally blind. And He is ever raising the dead: yet He did
     then really perform wonders of that kind also, as when He raised
     Jairus' daughter, and the widow's son and Lazarus. And
     though at all times, when awakened by His disciples, He quiets the
     storms and whirlwinds of His Church; yet it is unquestionable that
     those things also, which are in the history, really took place on
     that occasion. This therefore is the only sound way of receiving the
     sense of Scripture; nor ought we to lend an ear to those who affirm,
     that He was born by Mary, not of Mary."

     In which last sentence the connection above noticed is obvious,
     between the historical sense and Catholic doctrine.

     The following are instances of detail, which prove how carefully
     Origen carried this rule out in practice. In his commentary on our
     Lord's future coming in the glory of His Father with His
     angels, be had spoken thus^59:

     "Consider whether one say, that the Prophets in their sufferings of
     old bore an analogy to the Word, which had no form nor comeliness;
     but as the Son of Man cometh in the glory of His Father, so the
     Words abiding in the Prophets appear with Him, having become angels,
     keeping up in a kind of due proportion the glory which appertains to
     them."

     This allusive exposition, modestly enough proposed, he follows up
     with words of caution. "These, things we say, by no means slighting
     the doctrine of the second coming of the Son of God, as it is more
     simply understood,"

     In the commentary on Genesis^60, he answers the trite objections to
     the history of the ark,---how it could contain, such a multitude
     of animals, and the like,---by a calculation as to its
     admeasurement, which supposes the account literally true ; and on
     this, foundation, proceeds to build his Allegorical exposition
     shewing that be did not spare trouble to avoid the allegory,
     wherever it seemed possible.

     When he comes to the birth of Isaac, having quoted the well-known
     passage from the Epistle to the Galatians, he asks^61,

     "What then? Was not Isaac born after the flesh? Did not Sarah bear
     him? Was not he circumcised? This very sport of his with Ishmael,
     did it not take place in the flesh? This is the remarkable point in
     the Apostle's exposition, that those things even, concerning
     which there can be no doubt of their having been done in the flesh,
     he affirms to be allegorical."

     Having proposed a mystical interpretation of Abraham's marriage
     with Keturah and his second family, he adds an observation, which
     evinces that he did not think of annulling the historical sense^62.

     "If we remember the historical notices of the generations derived
     from her, we shall the more easily make out [the truth] about
     several nations mentioned in the Scripture, e. g. where it is said
     that Moses married a daughter of Jethro, the priest of Midian, which
     Midian we find was the son of Abraham by Keturah ; whereby we learn
     that Moses's wife was of the seed of Abraham, and not an alien.
     . . . And the like you will find in the generations of Ishmael,
     which if you diligently look into, you will discover many points of
     history unperceived the generality."

     Had it not been for these remarks coming in at the end, the whole
     tone of what he says about Keturah would lead one to suspect that he
     thought nothing of the literal sense : it is fair to conclude,
     therefore, that in other cases, where he is merely silent regarding
     it, he does by no means intend to disparage it.

     (18.) Further, I observe that many of the passages, in which he
     seems at first positively and expressly to reject the historical
     sense, not only may, but in fairness must, be explained with very
     great mitigations. Sometimes he is only speaking by comparison,
     employing the same kind of figure as did the Prophet, when he wrote,
     "I will have mercy and not sacrifice." Thus in discoursing of the
     history of Isaac^63, he says, "As in the Lord there is nothing
     bodily, so in all these things take care to understand nothing
     bodily." Which words sound indeed like a plain denial, first of the
     reality of our Lord's Incarnation, secondly of the truth of the
     narrative concerning Isaac : yet it is evident in the same page^64
     that Origen was orthodox in the former respect for he explains the
     real offering of the ram to represent the real suffering of Christ
     in the flesh, and the figurative offering of Isaac to represent the
     impassability of the Divine Word in the hour of crucifixion ; and we
     have seen before that he specifies the history of Isaac as an
     instance of the allegory not impairing the truth of the letter. Who
     does not see then that the expression "nothing bodily," must be
     taken in both clauses comparatively; "nothing merely outward and
     bodily?" And in all candour the same qualification should be adopted
     in all similar cases, whereever the context, or his opinion
     otherwise known, does not oblige us to understand him as going
     further. For example, a little further on in Genesis, having to
     explain a phrase, which seems tautological he says^65, "As I have
     often had occasion to observe, in these things not histories are
     related, but mysteries are framed and put together :" evidently
     meaning not so much histories as mysteries and implying that
     details, which might appear triffling or irrelevant considered only
     in themselves, are often amply accounted for when you go to the
     secondary sense : a rule of sacred criticism, which is surely no way
     objectionable.

     So again, in a fragment of a later part of his commentary on
     Genesis^66, remarking on the fear expressed by the sons of Jacob,
     lest "Joseph should take them for bondsmen and their asses," he
     says, "It is improbable what is told of the sons of Jacob, that when
     they imagined themselves in so evil case they should have thought at
     all of their asses : except the expression is used allegorically."
     By which, we may understand him not to deny the fact of their so
     speaking, but to account for their being directed to such
     expressions.

     Also in the account of the destruction of Ai, he says^67 : "When the
     Jews read these things, they make themselves cruel, and after human
     blood," "putantes quia et sancti ita percusserunt eos qui habitabant
     Ai:" i. e. acting upon the idea that the saints did so and so; not
     as if the idea were a false one, but as if they reasoned wrongly
     about it: for a sentence just before shews that this is one of the
     places to be expounded comparatively. He had said, "These^68 things
     which follow, belong rather to the truth of the mystery than of the
     narrative."

     It may be as well to note here, that the word m n Â¢ q o z , or
     fabula, for applying which to certain Old Testament histories,
     Origen has been very sharply censured, both in ancient and in modern
     times, did by no means imply, in his acceptation of it, the
     falsehood of the history so denominated. For he uses it of the
     history of Lot and his daughters, which he calls "famosissima
     fabula^69" and yet it is clear from the whole context, that he
     believed the narration and reasoned on it as real. We ought not,
     therefore, to be too much startled, when we find him using the word
     fables, concerning the history of Paradise, and of man before the
     Fall : though it cannot be denied, that on this particular point he
     has trespassed on the honour of the letter, and has taken occasion
     from the evident figure contained in certain phrases (such as "they
     heard the voice of God walking in the garden,") to affirm that the
     whole of what then took place is told only in symbol and parable :
     not (observe) denying that it conveys a real history, but that the
     said history is throughout written, as it were in hieroglyphics. We
     are not of course called on to justify this proceeding, but it is
     desirable, on many accounts, to observe how far the error went.

     (20.) We may just mention two other instances, on the former of
     which the accusers of Origen have very generally delighted to dwell.
     Both of them, however, a candid construction might perhaps solve on
     the principle now under consideration : viz. by supposing him rather
     to assert the superior importance than the exclusive truth, of the
     mystical interpretation. They both occur in the process of
     harmonizing the Gospels : the former in the accounts of our
     Lord's going down to Galilee, in the early part of His ministry
     ; the other in those of His anointing, whether that occurred once,
     twice, or three times.

     In the first instance, which has been already quoted for another
     purpose, Origen's^70 remark is, or appears to be (for there is
     an evident mutilation of the text) :

     "The very truth about these things must needs be stored up in the
     mystical exposition. If the discrepancy could not be solved, our
     faith concerning the Gospels must needs be impaired; as though they
     were either untrue, or uninspired, or as narratives not felicitously
     arranged."

     Then having stated the difficulty, and challenged the opponents of
     the mystical sense to solve it on any other hypothesis, he remarks
     in general on the Gospel narratives.

     "There are many other cases in which minute inquiry into the
     apparent historical discrepancies of the four Gospels will lead to
     one or other of these results; either the inquirer, feeling a kind
     of giddiness, will give up task of verifying them all in the strict
     sense, and will take up with one or other of them as it may happen;
     or receiving the whole four, will admit also that their truth does
     not lie in the outward and bodily characters wherein they are
     written."

     To make his meaning plainer in this first clause, he puts the
     case^71 of four persons, favoured with visions, relating the same
     Divine interposition, but varying in such a minute circumstance as
     this ; that the one saw the heavenly form sitting, the other
     standing ; yet each with truth represents that which his own mind
     perceived. And considering that the doings of our Lord on earth were
     a series of Divine visions, he says,

     "Why should we blame the Evangelists, for sometimes giving, as it
     were, each a turn of his own to the things done by our Lord,
     according to His miraculous and most inconceivable power
     ;---sometimes interweaving into their narrative, in language
     taken from sensible things, what was revealed to them in a sense
     purely spiritual? Why should we blame them, though for
     edification's sake they transpose facts, relating a thing in
     such a connexion, as to make it seem to have happened in one place
     or time, when in fact it happened in another?"

     And then he makes the observation so severely censured :

     "It was their purpose, when circumstances allowed, to speak truth
     both spiritually and literally; but where both could not be, to
     prefer the Spirit to letter, the spiritual truth being often
     preserved in what we may perhaps venture to call the literal and
     bodily falsehood."

     In the other passage to be considered together with this^72, he
     first states strongly the discrepancies of the literal sense, on the
     supposition that the several accounts of the woman anointing our
     Lord all relate to the same event; and the consequent reasonableness
     of supposing that they related to several persons and events. Then
     he adds, in a way which is readily understood as implying that he is
     now come to the solution which himself prefers,

     "Perhaps some one rather bolder than ordinary will say, whether
     historically it were some one woman only who did an act of this
     kind, or whether you choose to suppose another, or a third, still, I
     say, first, that the main object of the Evangelists had respect to
     certain mysteries; secondly, that they were not so very anxious to
     relate according to historical truth, as to set forth the mysteries
     which arose out of the history. On which account, also they added
     certain discourses, suitable to, and in harmony with, the meaning of
     those mysteries."

     (21.) Now concerning both these passages, let it not thought mere
     partiality, if we construe them as affirming more than a comparative
     exclusion of the literal meaning, a to enforce attention to the
     spirit, a deprecation of any unbelief or skepticism on account of
     literal difficulties very nearly to what is commonly said among
     ourselves, objections are alleged against the Scriptures from
     geological, astronomical, or other like incongruities, their letter.
     They are objections, people say, of a wrong kind ; it was not the
     object of the Scriptures to teach those matters. So here,
     comparatively speaking, we may understand this Father to say, "It
     was not the object of the Evangelists, simply to teach what happened
     to our Lord on earth, but to teach it with a view to the heavenly
     and Divine truths concerning Him."

     Just as of the history at the beginning of Exodus he says^73, "These
     things are not written for us," ad historiam, "as mere matters of
     history : neither are we to suppose that the divine books are
     relating the doings of the Egyptians." It is evident from the
     context, that he here means, "simply relating, for relating's
     sake :" that he is far from denying the verity of the letter,
     however he may seem to undervalue its importance. In such cases be
     may be regarded as endeavouring to account, not so much for any
     supposed untruth in a narrative, as for its being constructed in a
     way to make it look untrue.

     A case very much in point would be the statements, undoubtedly
     conflicting at first sight, of the process which our Lord adopted
     for healing the blind men at the gate of Jericho. Origen would say,
     and has said^74, that such appearance of disagreement did not come
     of itself; that it was framed on purpose, draw attention to the
     moral and mystery of the transaction ; which, in, every such case,
     will be found to be wonderfully brought out, by a search wisely
     instituted to remove the historical difficulty.

     (22.) A further mitigation of the censure due to him on this head
     may be derived from a remark of his Editor, De la Rue, who was at
     least enough on his guard against an editor's partiality for
     his author. He states it as a strange, yet certain fact, that Origen
     perpetually confuses the literal interpretation of a passage as
     distinct from the mystical, with the literal sense of the words as
     distinct from the metaphorical^75. "Quod pÃ¦ne incredibile videtur,
     Origenem latuit discrimen quod literam inter et verborum literalem
     sensum intercedit." It would have been a guarded, and perhaps a more
     correct manner of speaking, had he said only, that Origen sometimes
     writes as if he were not aware of this difference.

     To make the thing plain by example: among other instances of the New
     Testament having, as well as the Law, a letter which killeth, Origen
     alleges^76 the precepts of our LORD, "If any man hath a purse, let
     him take it, and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and
     buy one :" and "salute no man by the way ;" and e Ã¬s i n e Â¢ u n o
     u c o i o Ã¬Â¢ e Â¢ u n o Â¢ u c i s a n e Â¢ a u t o Ã¹z Ã²i a t h
     n b a s i l e Ãa n t v n o Â¢ u r a n v n . These passages, all men
     will allow to be figurative ways of expressing a real precept. Now
     his oversight was, that he applied the same principle to passages,
     which seemed to him fraught with historical difficulties: as in the
     account of Sarah and Abimelech, of Issac and Rebecca, and the
     midwives of Egypt ; where his expressions are such as these : "If
     any one chuse to understand this merely according to the letter, he
     ought to seek his hearers rather among Jews than among
     Christians^77," and "think you that these are no better than tales,
     and that the Holy Ghost is merely relating histories^78?" and "of we
     take what is written concerning the midwives according to the
     historical narrative, it appears that such and such a thing cannot
     stand^79." Yet if, the several histories be examined, it will be
     seen that to deny the truth of the fact is by no means necessary to
     his argument : the ends of which are sufficiently answered, by
     supposing him to deny, that this or that turn of expression was
     designed to be taken literally. Nay even according to his unfriendly
     editor's statement, if he were not sufficiently aware of the
     distinction between phrases mystical and merely metaphorical, he was
     very likely to mean the milder assertion, i. e. that the figurative
     expression was designedly made paradoxical, when he seems to advance
     the stronger, i. e. that it wanted the foundation of literal truth.

     For these and other like reasons, even though the school of Origen
     were a fair specimen of the old ecclesiastical interpretation, it
     would not follow that that interpretation could be charged with
     denying the letter, except in rare and difficult cases, where, as he
     has himself said, we miss altogether the historical meaning :
     "defectum patitur historialis intelligentia^80."

     (23.) But the matter is thrown out of all doubt, when we add to what
     has been said, the fact that the Church has virtually disowned all
     responsibility for the peculiar opinions of this renowned Father ;
     partly by the sentence of a general Council, partly by the
     deliberate judgment of some of her chief lights of later days. It is
     in some respects unfortunate, that that portion of the fifth general
     Council, which contained the proceedings against those called
     Origenists, has not come down to our time : but in the decisions of
     the Council, it is to be observed, that no mention is made of the
     denial of the letter of Scripture, as one of the supposed errors of
     Origen. The errors which were maintained in his name,---most of
     which may be described as mere conjectures, expressed as conjectures
     by him, and afterwards advanced to the rank of tenets, philosophical
     or theological, by speculators who made the most of so high a
     sanction ; such as the pre-existence of souls, the manner in which
     the merits of the Redeemer may be applied to angelic natures, the
     supposed universal renovation, and the like:---these errors are
     enumerated in fifteen articles^81 ; but the alleged abandonment of
     the literal sense of the Bible does not appear among them. However,
     the whole affair, coming as it does at the conclusion of three
     centuries of dispute, shows that there was no such blind deference
     to his authority, then or at any former time, as may render the
     Church liable on his account, to the charge of disparaging the
     letter of Holy Scripture.

     (24.) The opinions of the most celebrated Fathers are collected by
     the Benedictine editor, in his preface to the second volume^82. Such
     as the sentiment of St. Basil, in a passage quoted above^83: "I know
     laws of allegory, though not by my own invention, yet by
     acquaintance with the labours of others : according to which, they
     who will not receive the ordinary sense of what is written, in the
     account of the Creation for example, affirm water not to mean water,
     but some other nature : and plants and fishes they expound at their
     own pleasure; and the formation of creeping things, and of wild
     beasts, they pervert according to inventions of their own, much like
     those who profess to interpret dreams." St. Chrysostom again, as
     cited by De la Rue, remarks, that the geographical situation of
     Paradise, "eastward in Eden," may have been purposely inserted by
     the Sacred Spirit, "to prevent those who are inclined to useless
     talk from deceiving the ears of the simple, by stating that Paradise
     is not in earth but in heaven, or putting about any other the like
     mythological dreams^84."

     It is to be observed, that neither these Fathers, nor St. Augustine
     when he expresses similar sentiments, make any mention of the name
     of Origen : although Augustine, in more than one passage; condemns
     him by name, for the same doctrinal errors which were afterwards
     censured in the second Council of Constantinople. But they seem to
     have observed a kind of tenderness towards him, which makes their
     express warnings the more striking, and at the same time leaves room
     to suppose, that, according to the view which has been taken above,
     they might regard him as leading others to deny the letter of the
     Bible, than as being himself guilty of such an error on any large
     scale.

     St. Jerome and Epiphanius, as is well known, were less scrupulous in
     their attacks on Origen, probably (at least in part) as living among
     persons who were continually pushing his speculations into heresy.
     Nothing can be more express than protests against him^85, addressed
     to John, Patriarch of Jerusalem, for turning the Scriptures into
     mere allegory, as far as the history before the fall was concerned.

     Yet, as is often sarcastically alleged by the detractors of
     Ancients, not even Origen himself abounds more in mystical and
     figurative interpretations than did these two distinguished Fathers,
     St. Jerome and St. Augustine. Are we to conclude that such men wrote
     at random, and did not know their own mind on such a very serious
     point, as a rule of interpretation extending through the whole
     Scriptures? Must we rather conclude, that their censure of Origen as
     an allegorist, which, generally speaking, we may accept as the
     censure of the Church, went thus far, and no further? viz. to blame
     him for supposing that the literal sense would ever entirely vanish,
     however impossible it may be for us at times to ascertain it,
     however inferior it may generally or always be, in comparison with
     the mystical sense: to blame him, again, for objecting to it, as he
     sometimes occasionally does, (contrary however to his own declared
     rule) on grounds not flowing from the analogy the faith as held and
     interpreted by the Church, but such as we should call rationalistic
     ; such as a thing being to our minds inconsistent with the majesty
     of the Deity. Lastly, and perhaps principally, we may understand
     them to blame him for too great boldness and luxuriance, in
     advancing interpretations, not in any way received by tradition, but
     devised by his own thoughts. But not in an sense can they be said to
     condemn him simply for maintaining the double sense of the old
     Scriptures, in the very way, wherein, as we have seen, the whole
     body of Christian writers, from St. Barnabas and St. Clement
     downwards, had maintained it.

     (25.) And this is true not only of Jerome and Augustine, whose love
     for allegory is well known, but also of the other two names, Basil
     and Chrysostom, who are comparatively remarkable for reserve in such
     interpretations. Yet Basil, on the Psalms, repeatedly refers to our
     Lord expressions, which would be commonly interpreted of the
     Psalmist only. And Chrysostom (to say nothing of his practice) in
     the very passage which is cited from him so decidedly condemning
     Origen, points out the necessity of understanding all things q e o t
     r e p v z ^86.

     "The Lord God Paradise.' Consider, beloved ; if we do not
     understand these things in a sense becoming the Almighty, we shall
     needs be carried over a deep precipice. For what can they say
     concerning this word, ;planted,' who dare to take all the
     words concerning the Deity in a human sense? Did God need tools and
     husbandry, and other such process, to adorn Paradise? God forbid
     .... Against this, [as against the mere allegory,] let us stop our
     ears, and follow the rule of the Scripture. And when thou hearest,
     ;God planted a garden in the East,' take care to conceive
     of the word ;planted' in a divine sense concerning God,
     that He gave order for such a thing to be ; but as to the next word,
     believe thou that Paradise really was formed, and in where the
     Scripture hath pointed it out. For not to believe the things set
     down in the divine Scripture, but rather to introduce other things
     of one's own mind, must, I conceive, bring extreme danger to
     those who venture on such a proceeding."

     On the other hand, in his exposition of the 47th Psalm^87, he says,
     speaking of the verse, "O clap your hands, all ye people;"

     "With reason one might one take this Psalm according the mystical
     sense, rising above the literal meaning. For though it takes its
     beginning and prelude from things sensible, it guides the hearer to
     the things, which are merely spiritual. For, as I have said before,
     so now I say again, some we must take as they are said, some
     contrary to the e. g. when it is said, the wolf shall lie down with
     the lamb. Some in both senses ; as the sacrifice of Abraham, and the
     first paschal lamb."

     Compare this passage with the former, and it will be plain that
     while St. Chrysostom was earnest in condemning the too free
     speculations of a later age, there was nothing contrary to the mode
     of exposition, which, as we have seen, was adopted by the Fathers
     before Origen.

     On the whole, we may assume that the Mysticism of the ancient Church
     (whatever might be said of some individuals) was very far from
     interfering with the truth of the history. The next point will be to
     show, that neither did it interfere with moral truth, i. e. it did
     not, by prophetical exposition, of certain questionable parts of the
     Patriarchs' conduct, annul or confound the judgement of the
     well-informed moral sense, as to the rectitude such conduct. This
     however must be made matter of separate investigation.

            iv.--Mysticism as applied to the Moral Difficulties of
     Scripture.

     It has been endeavoured in the former sections, first, to shew
     distinctly what is meant, when the Fathers are charged with
     Mysticism, and to point out by example the need of extreme caution
     and reverence, whenever we approach that subject. Secondly, granting
     the fact that they are, generally speaking Mystics, at least in the
     interpretation of Scripture, (for to that in its present stage the
     inquiry is limited) a reason was however adduced for believing that
     they were not so at random, nor in mere blind obedience to the
     literary fashion of the day. The reason is this, that we find them,
     with few and rare exceptions, careful to limit their mystical
     expositions, so as not to destroy the historical and literal
     meaning. The exceptions, chiefly drawn from the Alexandrian school,
     were shortly considered, and appeared in themselves less formidable
     than they are sometimes represented : it appeared moreover, that
     whatever their amount, they so far tend to strengthen our argument,
     as they occasioned an anxious disavowal of the mere allegory, on the
     part of St. Basil, St. Augustine, and others, who had the best claim
     to be regarded as representing the whole Church. Their verdict is
     correctly reported in the following passages from Cyril of
     Alexandria^88.

     "In the inspired writings those who shrink from the literal and
     historical meaning as unsound, are chargeable in effect with
     something very like shrinking from the only process, can enable them
     to understand the things therein set down. For the investigation of
     them in the mystical way is indeed noble, and profitable; it tends
     to enlighten, throughly the eye of the mind, and greatly to advance
     us in good understanding : nevertheless, as often as any historical
     fact is introduced to us by the Scriptures, then surely, if ever, it
     becomes us to trace out the profitable use of the history, that the
     divine Scripture may do its work, saving and helping us in all
     ways."

     This was in agreement with the rule, which he had laid down for
     himself in the beginning of his commentary on the Pentateuch^89.

     "Our exposition will be useful, if we first consider the facts, as
     they really took place, and make part of history; and having as we
     may completed that view, if we then new-mould our statement, passing
     from the type and shadow to the clear account of the inward
     signification; our discourse having all the way a bearing on the
     Mystery of Christ, and tending to Him as its limit; since it is an
     unquestioned truth, that Christ is the end of the Law and the
     Prophets."

     Such had been the line of interpretation, which, the Fathers of the
     first age, by a kind of sacred instinct, adopted, from the
     beginning: and in no other did those of the fourth and fifth ages
     acquiesce, after full examination, and abundant opportunity of
     judging how far it was likely to be abused.

     (2.) We have now to consider this mystical method in its application
     to one class of texts in particular; those portions, namely, of the
     Old Testament history which record actions of questionable morality
     on the part of God's favoured servants. So it is, that in
     modern times, even among those who appear truly, to reverence the
     Bible, there is commonly adopted, in regard of these startling
     passages, a tone of explanation and remark, very different from that
     which prevailed in the early ages of the Church. It seems desirable,
     for many reasons, to ascertain the amount of that difference, and
     how it may be best accounted for. We may find perhaps that the
     patristical mode of interpretation, rightly understood, interferes
     as little with moral as it before was found to interfere with
     historical truth ; and the whole discussion may tend to convince us,
     that on this, as on most theological subjects, we have much more to
     learn from the Fathers, than to apologize for in them.

     (3.) That the Fathers, deeply as they were versed in every part of
     the inspired writings, were fully aware of this kind of Scripture
     difficulty, one might be certain beforehand, on considering that it
     is a difficulty which occurs to every person, even to children,
     perusing the Old Testament with an ordinary degree of attention. Nor
     do we find commonly in their writings any desire to evade the
     subject, or to draw off attention from it. There were controversies
     indeed in the four first ages, which would have forced it
     continually on their thoughts as polemical writers ; such as that
     with the Marcionites first, and afterwards with the ManichÃ¦ans, who
     used the startling parts of the sacred history, as proofs that the
     Old Testament came from an evil, or at least from an imperfect,
     Being : or again, that which they had constantly to maintain with
     the Pagan Philosophers, who, as appears from Celsus and Julian, were
     not slow to employ this topic against Christians and Jews alike :
     but the remarkable thing is, that the same narrations are produced,
     and discussed without reserve, in their practical and popular
     writings also, their pastoral letters to individuals, and their
     homilies ad populum. There seems no desire on their part to withdraw
     these, things from common observation, such as we now find not
     unfrequently, even among those who on other grounds would encourage
     the freest discussion and circulation of the Scriptures. Their
     reserve, their secret discipline, so perplexing to many in our days,
     did not extend to these things.

     (4.) Neither do we find that even those, who took tile greatest
     liberties in allegorizing, who came nearest in some instances to the
     denial of the letter,---not even that such as
     Origen,---thought themselves warranted in getting rid of the
     moral difficulty, arising from the places in question, by resorting
     to the mere allegory. They did so, or appeared much inclined to do
     so, where the literal statement seemed physically or historically
     impossible : occasionally also where it seemed very trifling or
     frivolous ; but it is not so easy to meet with a passage, where the
     same solution is applied to any narrative, merely on the ground of
     its apparent immorality; which yet, with our modern notions, would
     seem to be the most tempting ground of all.

     This remark is made with all the hesitation, which becomes one who
     ventures on a sweeping statement after a very limited induction. But
     should it be found on the whole correct, it is surely a very
     considerable circumstance, and may help to convince us that these
     early theologians knew well what they were about, and did not use
     their solutions at random, just as difficulties happened to press,
     or ingenious answers came to hand. Celsus, as it appears from
     Origen^90, charged the apologists of the Bible with this very
     artifice; "that the more plausible among them,

     being ashamed of certain portions of their sacred books, refuge in
     the allegorical meaning :" and among other instances from the Book
     of Genesis he alleged the disputes of and Esau, the conduct of
     Rebecca, the histories of Lot and of Jacob's family.
     Origen's answer in effect comes to this^91 : he disavows all
     intention of denying the fact in such histories as mentioned. "In
     many instances," says he, "the word [of God], hath made use of real
     transactions, and recorded them so as to exhibit things greater,
     covertly indicated, such as are [among others] the marriages and
     various connections of the righteous men [of old]." Farther on he
     contrasts the patriarchal narrative with the foul and revolting
     fictions of the Greek which, as he observes, were indeed full of
     shamefulness, taken in their first acceptation, relating as they did
     to very gods and the sons of their gods ; and having enforced by the
     virtual confession of those Greek philosophers, such as Chrysippus,
     who had laboured to make out the symbolical purport of their fables,
     he proceeds as follows :

     "Because of these things---because of such fables as these and
     others innumerable, we for our part are unwilling to go so far as
     even in name to call the Supreme God (e.g.) Jupiter ; or the Sun,
     Apollo ; or the Moon, Diana. But exercising pure religion towards
     the Creator, and concerning His works, which are very good, using
     none but good and auspicious words, not even by a name do we pollute
     the things of God : accepting what Plato says in the PhilÃ¦bus :
     ;so great,' says he, ;is the dread which I feel
     concerning the names of the gods.' We also, of a truth, are
     full of dread concerning the Name of our God and His good creatures,
     to that degree, that never could we admit, even under pretence of
     symbolical language, any tale or fable which tends to the corruption
     of the young^92."

     The argument of this passage may seem to require explanation. It may
     be briefly stated thus. "The fact is well known that believers in
     the Bible decline even the metaphoric use of the names of the
     heathen gods ; so great is their abhorrence of the impious immoral
     stories with which those names are associated; judge you then
     whether they are likely, under any pretence of allegory, to admit,
     as vehicles of their own doctrines, stories really base and
     immoral."

     From all this it is sufficiently manifest, that the line of defence
     taken by Origen, and a fortiori by those who were less prone to
     allegory, would be, to vindicate on their own grounds the moral
     tendencies of the several statements objected to, assuming their
     historical truth. How far such his vindications were or were not
     independent of the allegorical meaning, which he also asserted, and
     for which he argues at large in this very passage, is another
     question, to be considered hereafter in its place.

     (5.) Now there is a strong presumption, at first setting out,
     against the supposition that the Fathers dealt lightly with this
     class of Scripture difficulties, that they trifled with them or
     treated them in a way to disturb men's notions of morality. For
     it is a certain fact, that the early Christian moralists, whether
     nominally attached to any particular school or no, were none of them
     in any sense Epicureans nor utilitarians. They all held expressly or
     by instinct, a moral sense in the heart of man and its correlative,
     a real difference of right and wrong in human conduct, independent
     of all results.

     It was partly, on this ground that they preferred to all others the
     schools of Pythagoras and Plato, a preference which is fully stated
     and accounted for at large by St. Augustin, in his eighth Book on
     the City of God. A few passages may be given, a tending to show what
     line Christian philosophers (for in their name generally St.
     Augustin is speaking, and not of his own private opinions) would be
     likely to pursue on delicate points of casuistry.

     With regard then to the moral sense, he exclaims^93 :

     "Far be it from us to think of comparing the Platonists with those,
     who make the bodily senses the standard of truth, and pronounce
     them, faithless and deceitful as they are, the rule and measure of
     all proportions; as do the Epicureans and all of the like source :
     as the very stoics also themselves, who in their fond affection for
     Dialectic, as they term it, i.e. for the art of ingenious
     argumentation, have imagined that even it might be best derived,
     ultimately from the bodily senses; affirming that from no other
     source does the mind conceive the notions, which they call primary
     (ideas i.e. of certain things which their theory goes on to define
     particularly), and from which is deduced and framed the whole
     process of learning and of teaching But the Platonists (deservedly
     therefore preferred by us) distinguish what the mind beholds from
     what strikes on the bodily senses; neither denying to the senses
     what they are capable of, nor assigning to them more than they will
     bear. But the light of the mind, whereby all things are to be
     learned, they affirmed to be no other than the God by whom all
     things were made."

     A little further on, he writes as follows : (The passage is here
     quoted, not so much for the astonishing depths which it discloses of
     what may be called Christian Philosophy, as because the author
     states himself to be speaking not his own private sentiments, but
     the feeling avowed or instinctive, of the whole Church^94.)

     "So far as the Platonists agree with us , concerning one God, the
     Author of this universe, who is not only above all bodies, Himself
     incorporeal, but also above all souls, Himself incorruptible, our
     Source, our Light, our Good---so far we prefer them to all
     others. What if any Christian, ignorant of their literature, use not
     their terms in disputation, (how should he, since he had never
     learned them?) what if he neither call that branch Physics, which
     treats of inquiry into things natural ; nor that Logic, which
     analyses the process whereby truth may be discerned : nor that
     Ethics which treats of conduct,---of the chief good to be sought,
     and the chief evil to be avoided? he knows nevertheless that all
     three from the one true and most bountiful God ; both our nature,
     whereby we are formed according to His image ; and the doctrine,
     whereby we may know both Him and ourselves ; and the grace, whereby,
     cleaving to Him, we may be perfectly blessed. Behold here the cause
     of the preference we give to the Platonists : that while other
     philosophers have worn out their toil and their talents searching
     for the cause of things, the rules of learning and of life ; these
     alone acknowledging God, have found the cause of the world as it is,
     the light of all truth that may be attained, the fountain of all
     bliss that may be tasted. Be these philosophers then Platonists, or
     whoever else of whatever nation, who think thus of God, they think
     with us."

     In Origen we have repeated disavowals of the principles of the other
     sects, and repeated acknowledgements of the remarkable coincidence
     between the principles of Plato's morality, and those which the
     Gospel divinely sanctions. Of the former class, the following is a
     specimen^95 :

     The Christians are likened by Celsus to one, who professing to cure
     bodily sickness, should withdraw men from skilful physicians, for
     fear of having their ignorance detected. But who, I ask, are these
     physicians from whom we thus withdraw the simple? Suppose it, for
     example, to be the philosophy of Epicurus, and those who belong to
     his school, what do we that is not most reasonable, liberating men
     from that evil disease, the result of these favourite physicians of
     Celsus : I mean the denial of Providence, and recommendation of
     pleasure as the chief good? Or what again, if we draw off our
     disciples from those other physician-philosophers who are called
     Peripatetics ; denying as they do all providence over mankind, all
     relation between God and man? what is this but an exercise in piety
     on our part, and a real mental cure to those whom we influence?
     Grant again, that there are others, whom we separate from the
     physicians of the Stoical class, the maintainers of a corruptible
     God of a bodily or perishable substance : in this case too, can any
     one deny that we shall be delivering those who will believe us from
     many evils, and introducing them to the doctrine of true piety, the
     doctrine of resignation to the Creator of the world ?

     To this rejection of all other theories, he elsewhere adds express
     approbation of Plato's, of which perhaps no instance can be
     adduced more remarkable than this:

     "Let those who are able to understand receive the instruction of
     ancient and wise men ; of Plato especially, the son of Ariston ; let
     us hear what he says in a certain letter concerning the chief good :
     let us attend to him, affirming, ;the first and chiefest good
     can in nowise be uttered in words, but is first generated by long
     habit, and then on a sudden, as though by fire, starting into a
     blaze, is kindled like a light in the soul.' Which words we
     also hearing, assent unto them as excellently spoken : for it was
     God Himself who revealed to them those things, and whatsoever else
     has been rightly taught by them."

     (7.) To the same purpose may be alleged those passages in Clement of
     Alexandria, peculiarly startling to those whose views are framed
     upon the phraseology of modern theologians, wherein be speaks of the
     old Pagans being in a certain sense justified by philosophy^96 ; of
     its being necessary to them for righteousness before the coining of
     our Lord ; of its constituting one out of many ways or gates of
     righteousness^97, whereby men, according to God's manifold
     goodness, might be and were variously led towards the royal way and
     gate. These and similar high expressions relate especially to the
     Platonic morals : although it is true that in his general
     commendations of philosophy he wished to be understood as adopting
     an eclectic process : he says :

     "I mean not the Stoical or the Platonic alone, nor yet that of
     Epicurus, nor of Aristotle ; but whatsoever sayings may be found in
     each of those sects, rightly inculcating righteousness with
     religious consideration, those taken all together by way of
     selection I term philosophy^98."

     This eclecticism may very well stand with an exclusive preference of
     Plato's doctrine, as to the unchangeable nature of moral good
     arising out of the unchangeable attributes of God ; a doctrine with
     which Clement every where indicates his concurrence : e. g. where he
     calls Justice natural, and especially in that remarkable place which
     conveys his exposition of the critical word Justification^99 ;

     "You have been justified,' says the Apostle, ;in the
     name of the Lord ; you have been made by Him, so to speak,
     righteous, as He is righteous ; and in the greatest possible
     measure, according to your capacity, you have been blended and
     united with the Holy Spirit of God.'"

     This sentence clearly evinces, that when be spoke of philosophy
     justifying the heathen, he was far from any thought of its meriting
     for them, in the strict sense of the word, forgiveness of sins : he
     was speaking of inherent goodness, and that, he affirmed, philosophy
     gave them, so far as they may have really practised it, by the
     secret aid of God's good Spirit, and so far as they may have
     become, accordingly, conformed to God's image ; an idea which
     evidently applies to the Platonist alone, among heathen schools of
     morality.

     Such is, what has sometimes been called in scorn, the Platonism of
     the early Church ; the allegation implied in that name being about
     as correct, as if one should say, the sun's light was borrowed
     from the reflection of the moon in the water. The passages have been
     adduced, not to prove the fact, for that is allowed on all hands ;
     but as putting strongly before the mind the sort of view, which the
     ecclesiastical writers were likely to take of those narratives of
     Holy Writ, which we may call, in one sense, painfully perplexing. We
     see that they could not consistently explain. them by any view,
     however enlarged, of expediency, a greater good resulting in the end
     ; they must either leave the several difficulties as they found
     them, or make them out in some way positively consistent with
     God's eternal law.

     (8.) We are far, however, from being left to antecedent
     probabilities on this head. St. Augustin, in his treatise against
     Faustus the ManichÃ¦an, has left us an elaborate statement of the
     principle on which, as he conceived, objections of the kind now in
     question are to be met, accompanied with many exemplifications. The
     ManichÃ¦ans, as, is well-known, affirmed the Old Testament to be the
     work of the Evil Principle ; and one of their main arguments was
     grounded on the distressing parts of the Old Testament history.
     Indeed, the similarity is wonderful between the blasphemies of
     Faustus as they are recited by St. Augustin, and those of many
     modern unbelievers : whether the replies of St. Augustin agree as
     well with those most in favour among modern vindicators of Scripture
     is another question ; of which more will be said presently.

     He addresses himself to the inquiry with all the religious care,
     which might be expected from his deep reverence and affection for
     the Bible : stating himself, in the outset, to have in view the
     case, not so much of the Manichaeans,---whose theology, as well
     as their moral conduct, proved that they could not adduce such
     objections in earnest,---as of others, who, without any vain
     teaching of their's, found in themselves disturbing thoughts,
     on comparing the life of Prophets in the Old Testament with the life
     of the Apostles in the New. He says^100 :

     "That we may not proceed rashly in our moral judgment of these
     matters, we shall do well first to consider, what is sin : then to
     look into the deeds of the Saints registered in the divine books,
     that if any instances we find even them to have sinned, we may
     ascertain, as diligently as we can, for what good end their sins
     also were set down, and committed to memory. Next, in whatsoever
     cases we find what appears sin to the foolish or ill-disposed, not
     being such, yet not having in it any obvious example of goodness :
     we shall have to consider for what cause these things found a place
     in those Scriptures, which our faith tells us were written for our
     [soul's] health, to control us in this life, and obtain for us
     that which is to come. Lastly, whatsoever among the deeds of the
     Saints shine forth as lessons of righteousness, no man, even among
     the simple and ignorant, doubts the propriety of recording these. Of
     the two classes, then, there may be a question ; first, those which
     may seem to be recorded idly, not having any goodness found in them,
     not being sins ; secondly, those, the relation of which, may appear
     even pernicious, their sinfulness being undeniable, and they not
     unlikely to be drawn into precedent. In which latter kind again we
     may observe a further distinction. For some of these, actions are
     uncensured in the Scripture itself, and may, therefore, by some be
     imagined no sin at all; others are indeed reproved in the Bible, yet
     may be committed with an hope of easy pardon, being such as are
     found even in those holy men."

     (9.) A fairer or fuller statement of the case could hardly be given
     in the same number of words. Observe now how absolutely he lays down
     the doctrine of immutable morality, as the whereby to try the
     conduct of the Saints, no less than the ordinary conduct of ordinary
     men. He proceeds^101 :

     "Sin is something done, said, or desired contrary to the eternal
     law. By the eternal law I mean the Divine reason or Will of God,
     commanding the preservation, forbidding the disturbance, of the
     natural order of things."

     Presently after he applies this standard to the cases enumerated by
     Faustus, such as the polygamy of Abraham and Jacob ; Abraham's
     conduct when with Sarah in Egypt; the histories of Lot, Judah,
     David, and others ; the sanguinary wars and executions of Moses. And
     how uncompromising his casuistry was, we may see in the treatise De
     Mendacio : where he denies the lawfulness of any kind of lie, even
     for the saving of a man's life or soul, and maintains that all
     the cases alledged from the Old Testament in excuse or commendation
     of those who take such liberties, either had not the nature of lies,
     or are proposed as warnings, not as examples to mankind.

     Such being in general the strictness of the Fathers' morality,
     it is nevertheless undeniable, that they treat the passages in
     question---St. Augustin himself, the asserter of a rule so
     inflexible treats them---in a tone at which modern ears are apt
     to be startled : positively and unreservedly praising some things,
     which the men of this age either boldly censure, or condescendingly
     try to excuse, or at best shrink from discussing, as they would from
     the touch of a hot iron : and using much doubt and reserve in their
     censure of others, which to us are apt to seem clear and
     unquestionable cases of gross immorality.

     (10.) Now with regard to the former class---the cases where the
     approbation of the Fathers is more positive than we should venture
     on,---it perhaps will be found that they generally spoke from a
     strong impression (which might or might not be well-grounded in the
     particular case) that the person was acting by express command, or
     secret but sure inspiration, of Almighty God. The most signal
     instance of the kind is Abraham's sacrifice of his son : the
     command for which is too plainly set down in the Old Testament, and
     the praise of it in the New too marked and emphatical, to admit of
     its being, called in question by any believer ; but it is not always
     felt how far the principle of it extends---that to it, as to the
     head of a class, may be referred very many of the passages which
     startle men, by representing God's favoured servants as acting
     with apparent cruelty and harshness. The Fathers deeply felt this :
     they felt that where God had plainly spoken, the justifications and
     arguments of men were out of Place : nor did they doubt His having
     means to make His own voice so clear to His servants, that they need
     not fear its coming from any Spirit but His. And therefore
     St.Augustin, defending God's people against the charge of
     wronging the Egyptians, felt that be had said enough for them, if he
     brought them under the same category with Abraham : i. e. if he
     showed that they as well as Abraham had an express command from God.
     And this the very ManichÃ¦ans must allow; for even Faustus, in
     general so unsparing, had dared not insert the sacrifice of Isaac in
     his charges against the Patriarchs ; probably because it would have
     been too offensive, so clear was the verdict of exceeding praise
     bestowed on that act in the New Testament. St. Augustin's reasoning
     is so worded^102 :---

     "Some acts there are which the Eternal Lord has set before men as in
     a kind of middle station, so that, our taking them on ourselves
     would be justly blamed for presumption, but in fulfilling them,
     commanded, we earn the praise of obedience. So much difference does
     it make in the natural place and station of things not only who is
     acting, and what is done, but also under whose authority. Abraham,
     had he sacrificed his son of his own accord, what would he have
     shown himself, but fearfully profane and detestable? What, when he
     did so at God's bidding, but full of all faith and devotion?"

     (Elsewhere^103, in comparing Abraham's act with Jephtha's,
     he had made this the leading difference : that the one, being
     bidden, offered his son ; the other did what was forbidden by the
     law of Moses, and not enjoined on him by any special command.) .

     "Wherefore, if in the slaughter of a son the voluntary act would be
     accursed, but the dutiful obeying God's voice not only
     unblameable but glorious; why, O Faustus, blamest thou Moses, for
     having spoiled the Egyptians? If thine anger is moved by the
     apparent disonesty, supposing the act human, let thy fear be also
     moved by the Divine authority of Him who enjoined it. Or, art thou
     prepared to blame God Himself for willing such things to be done?
     Then ;get thee behind me, Satan, for thou savourest not the
     things which be of God, but those which be of men.'"

     He proceeds to apply the same principle to the wars of Moses and
     Joshua, and the destruction of the Canaanites^104---

     "The wars wrought by Moses we need not admire or shudder at, for in
     them he followed the Divine command it was not cruelty, but
     obedience .^105 Why then rush we into daring reproaches, I would I
     could say, of men only, and not of God? What, if the ministers and
     dispensers of the Old Testament, who were also harbingers of the
     New, did their office by slaying sinners ; while those ministers of
     the New, being also expositors of the Old, did theirs by dying under
     the hands of sinners ? Yet both aid their office to God---to Him
     who teaches that at divers but convenient seasons, from Him temporal
     goods must be sought, and for Him they are to be despised : by Him
     temporal chastisements are enjoined, and for Him they ought to be
     endured."

     So Theodoret, speaking of the slaughter of Agag by Samuel^106 : "He
     slew him as Phinehas did Zimri : for whatever God commands is
     religious." And Cyril, with no less simplicity and piety^107:

     "We ought unhesitatingly, attributing rectitude to the verdict
     pronounced in Heaven, to keep ourselves from all thoughts of cavil,
     and hasten to accomplish what is bidden, though it be something not
     very agreeable to our own understandings. E. g. Saul spared Agag :
     .whereby he offends God, and that greatly ; for he dealt gently with
     him who was appointed to die ; his conduct being all one as if be
     bad proclaimed in so many words, that God had passed an unjust
     sentence on Agag.

     (11.) To many persons, reading their Bibles with unprejudiced and
     simple minds, it may seem as if on this point we were multiplying
     unnecessary quotations. "Obey my voice," is to them, and they feel
     that it must ever have been to God's Saints, all in all,
     without further inquiry. But it seemed desirable to give full
     expression to the patristical view of cases like that of
     Abraham's sacrifice, for the sake of comparing it with a notion
     which seems to find favour with many in our days. Antiquity was
     content, when once it discerned a plain injunction from above : but
     the restless ingenuity of this age will not permit us heartily to
     acquiesce in the praises even of such as Abraham, except under cover
     of a certain theory of accommodation. Human sacrifices, we are told,
     and particularly the sacrifice of children by their parents, were
     notoriously practised by the nations of Canaan : God had not yet
     declared His abhorrence of such sacrifices : they were practised in
     that time and country as the most solemn rite of religion :
     therefore, whatever Abraham's feelings might be, his conscience
     was not startled at the command to offer his son---it was not yet
     an enlightened conscience---it partook of the barbarity of his
     time and country : allow for that, and Christians may contemplate
     the sacrifice of Isaac with edification, but without such allowance
     it will be a stumbling-block.

     In like manner, the destruction of the Canaanites, the slaughter of
     the Midianitish women by Moses, of the Amalekites and Agag by Saul
     and Samuel, were not blameable in those times, because in those
     times "the laws of war, if so they may be called, were so thoroughly
     barbarous, that no amount of slaughter committed against enemies was
     likely to shock the feelings of any one." Samuel, in short, was a
     half-civilized person, and therefore might be justified in putting
     Agag to death, in obedience to the plain command of God ; but "to
     men in an advanced state of moral knowledge and feeling, the command
     to perpetrate such general slaughter would be so revolting, that
     they could not and ought not to think that God could possibly be the
     author of it."

     (12.) Now, not to dwell here, on the fact, that the iniquity of the
     Amorites, in, Abraham's time, was declared to be not yet full,
     and that the book of Deuteronomy seems to speak of their burning
     their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods, as the
     crowning act of that iniquity; considerations which would seem to
     throw no small doubt on the statement that human sacrifices were
     usual in Canaan in Abraham's time; neither would that doubt at
     once be removed by the mention of such sacrifices as practised by
     the Moabites many generations after :---not to insist on the
     remonstrance of Elisha, "Wouldest thou destroy those whom thou hast
     made captive by thy sword and by thy bow?" as an indication that the
     then received "laws of war" were not in all cases altogether so
     barbarous as the above argument requires :---omitting for the
     present objections of the historical sort, and only just noticing
     the obvious remark, that the higher and gentler a person's
     general tone of moral feeling, the less likely, one should think,
     would he be to be hurt and corrupted by a command to execute
     vengeance in some isolated case, however unsparingly ;---on
     granting which, the whole speculation vanishes :---passing over
     these and other considerations, the one thing now to be observed is,
     the striking contrast between the tone and manner of St. Augustin,
     and of the modern apology for the Bible : how completely the one
     mounts above, the other defers to, the natural cravings of a refined
     intellect after full satisfaction and explanation ; how fearlessly
     the one acquiesces in God's will, while the other would check
     us in such acquiescence, by philosophical calculations, of the
     result of such and such conduct on the tempers and character of the
     agent ; how the one in short walks entirely by faith, the other
     requires more or less of intellectual sight. On that one distinction
     we might perhaps reasonably join issue, which of the two schools may
     be more safely followed, as a guide through the difficulties of
     Scripture.

     It will be said, perhaps, that the Fathers themselves have given
     their sanction to this principle of moral accommodation, pleading as
     they do for some of the Old Testament characters, the comparative
     imperfection of the light and strength which they enjoyed. But if we
     mark it well, we shall find this material difference between their
     accommodation, (if it may be so called,) and that which has been
     considered above,---that they never apply it to actions
     positively commanded or approved of God. It belongs either to
     characters, such as Rahab and the midwives of Egypt, who were on the
     whole praised and accepted, in spite of some immorality in the means
     they employed ; which immorality however was less in them than it
     would have been in us, on account of the greater imperfection of
     their knowledge :---or else it appertains to enactments or
     permissions, having in them more or less of a ritual and
     positive---one might almost say, of a sacramental---nature ;
     "the custom of that time, when the promise was veiled, as
     distinguishable from the custom of this time, when the promise is
     revealed," So writes St. Augustin^108, with a view especially to the
     domestic history of the Patriarchs. And perhaps ,we might refer to
     this head the whole subject of the law of marriage, both before and
     after the time of Moses, as compared with that which had existed in
     Paradise, and which our Saviour renewed in the Christian Church.

     Of this latter class St. IrenÃ¦us is speaking, where, having quoted
     St. Paul's permissive sentences in I Cor. vii he infers^109 :

     "If even in the New Testament we find the Apostles allowing some
     precepts on a principle of condescension, because of the
     incontinence of certain persons, lest such, becoming obdurate and
     altogether despairing of their salvation, fall entirely away from
     God ; it is no wonder, should the same God in the Old Testament also
     have willed something of the kind, alluring His people for their
     good by the aforesaid observances, whereby they might at least learn
     to keep the Ten Commandments, and feel them such a check as should
     prevent their turning to idolatry, and becoming apostates from God ;
     nay, and whereby they might learn to love Him with their whole
     heart."

     Thus IrenÃ¦us, to explain how the Mosaical permission of divorce
     might harmonize with the purer Evangelical Law, coming in its
     season. It was matter of permission, as our Lord Himself hinted to
     the Pharisees when they pressed Him with it. For they having asked,
     did Moses command divorce?" , He in His reply corrected the
     expression ; "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts
     suffered" (not enjoined) "you to put away your wives: but from the
     beginning it was not so."

     (14.) For an illustration of the other kind of moral accommodation
     we may refer to St. Augustin, de Mendacio^110.

     "Whereas it is written, that God dealt bountifully with the Hebrew
     midwives, and with Rahab, the harlot of Jericho ; that was not
     because of the falsehoods they uttered, but because of the kindness
     they showed to the people of God. It was not then their deceit which
     received a reward, but their good and dutiful affection. . . . For
     as it would not appear strange nor unreasonable, should God in
     consideration of their later good works be willing to forgive
     certain evil works formerly committed by them ; so neither is it any
     thing wonderful, if God ; at one time and in one transaction
     beholding both,---a deed of mercy and one of deceit,---did not
     only reward the one as good, but also with a view to that goodness
     did forgive the other which was evil... We may understand then that
     to those women, to the one in Egypt, to the other in Jericho, was
     rendered according to their humanity and mercy a reward, of this
     world indeed, but such as might also in prophetic shadow represent,
     unknown to themselves, something eternal. But whether at any time it
     be right to tell a lie, even for the sake of saving a man ; this
     being a question, the solution of which even the most learned find a
     weary task, was of course far beyond the compass of ordinary women,
     dwelling where they did, and with the tone of morals they were used
     to. Accordingly, this ignorance of theirs, as also their equal
     blindness in many other things, things which are reserved to be
     known by the children not of this world but of the next ; this
     ignorance, I say, the long suffering of God endured. . . . As to
     Rahab, when she did that deed,---good and laudable, considering
     her state of life,---she was not yet such as that one should
     require of her, ;Let your conversation be, Yea, yea, Nay,
     nay.' But we, in our inquiries whether any kind of lie can ever
     suit a good man, have an eye to the case not of an Egyptian, not of
     one appertaining to Jericho or Babylon, nor of one who is still a
     denizen of the earthly Jerusalem, which is in bondage with her
     children ; but of a citizen of that city which is above, our mother
     eternal in the heavens,"

     (15.) Hitherto those cases only have been considered, in which the
     approbation of Holy Writ is express ; let us now proceed to those
     which may seem to be left doubtful, being simply recorded with no
     clear precept or commendation. And here it will be obvious to the
     most cursory examiner, that amidst great individual diversity, the
     Fathers, as a body, in discussing such cases, almost always lean to
     the favourable side. They do so in a degree, which to persons with
     mere modern associations may often appear extravagant, sometimes
     even shocking. In this they might be suspected of merely indulging,
     perhaps unknown to themselves, the very natural wish of being always
     on the side, as it were of those whom they believed and knew for
     certain to be on God's side. One might be tempted to allow a
     good deal for such partiality, were it not that the Fathers have
     themselves explained, fully and frankly, the principles on which
     they so acted. Those principles are mainly two : the one, a hearty
     sense of the Communion of Saints, as a still subsisting bond of
     union between them and the Patriarchal and Mosaical ages ; the other
     (which shall be first exemplified) a deep and reverential sense of
     God's peculiar Presence and Interference through the whole of
     this history ; a trembling consciousness that they were near the
     invisible line which separates His agency from that of His rational
     creatures; which thought, wherever it becomes habitual, will
     necessarily make a religious man slow to censure, lest he be found
     blaming his Maker's work unawares. This is the account of those
     passages of the Fathers, in which, considering the mystical meaning
     as undoubted, they seem to allege it as stopping the mouths of
     gainsayers. To do any thing like justice to their view, we must copy
     the acute reasoning of St. Augustin himself^111.

     "I lay down this first of all, that not only the tongues of those
     men, but their very lives also, were prophetical ; that the whole
     kingdom of the Hebrews was as it were a great prophet, great because
     He is great who was the subject of the prophecy. Wherefore in regard
     of those among them, whose hearts were trained in the wisdom of God,
     we must look for prophecies of the Christ who should come, and of
     His Church, not only in what they said, but also in what they did ;
     in regard of other individuals, and of the whole nation
     collectively, the field of prophecy lies rather in what God did with
     them and for them. For all ;these things,' as the Apostle
     says, ;were our ensamples,' our types or figures.

     "And whereas the ManichÃ¦ans in certain actions, the depth of which
     they are far from comprehending, blame what they call the sensuality
     of the prophets ; this is no more than parallel to the reproaches
     which are cast by certain sacrilegious heathens on our Lord Himself,
     for folly, or rather for madness, in seeking fruit on a tree at an
     unseasonable time of year, or for a sort of childish simplicity, in
     stooping His head and writing, on the ground, and after His answer
     to certain questions beginning to do the same again. For why? they
     have no wisdom, no sense to perceive that in great souls certain
     excellences resemble certain blemishes in the mean and worthless ;
     there is some slight show, but no real fairness, in the comparison.
     And they who find such fault with the nobler sort are like untutored
     boys in school, who having learned for a great discovery that
     singular nouns require singular verbs, criticise the most skilful of
     Latin authors for the phrase, ;Pars in frusta secant.'
     ;For,' say they, ;he should have written secat.'

     "On which one might perhaps without absurdity remark, that the
     verbal turns and figures of learned men are not further distant in
     their kind from the ungrammatical and barbarous phraseology of the
     ignorant, than are the figurative needs of the Prophets from the
     sensual enormities of bad men. By which rule, as a boy, who should
     plead Virgil's figure by way of excuse for bad grammar, would
     be presently beaten with rods; so should any person guilty of
     adultery with his servant plead Abraham's example, who raised
     up seed of Hagar, good were it for that man to meet with some
     severer chastisement, and not be eternally punished with other
     adulterers. I grant that of these comparisons one side are the
     merest trifles, the other side truly great ; neither does our
     analogy tend to such a thing as making a grammatical figure as
     important as a mystery, a solecism equally culpable with an act of
     adultery ; only, by proportion, in their several kinds, what skill
     and ignorance are in the virtues and vices (so to call them) of
     language, that, although in a widely different kind, are wisdom and
     folly in those moral virtues and vices."

     (16.) St. IrenÃ¦us more briefly had taught the same doctrine long
     before, vindicating the harmony of the two Testaments against the
     Gnostics, who were in fact but an earlier development of the
     ManichÃ¦an school. He says^112 :

     "The great Revealer is the Son of the Father, as being from the
     beginning with the Father. By Him accordingly prophetic visions, and
     differences of gifts, His own ministeries and the Father's
     glory, have been manifested to the race of man, in a certain train
     and regular system, at such time as was expedient. For where things
     follow each other in order, there is consistency and harmony ; and
     where is harmony, there each thing is suited to the time ; and where
     there is such suitableness, there is true expediency."

     This is the same principle as was before observed on in Augustin,
     that God's eternal law measures alike all dispensations, but
     that part of that law is a certain equitable consideration of
     circumstances ; and so far IrenÃ¦us too admits a kind of
     accommodation or moral economy. He goes on : "For this cause the
     Word became Dispenser, Steward, Distributer of the Father's
     grace, according the needs of mankind, for whose sake He contrived
     so vast arrangements." He proceeds to explain, that one of these
     arrangements or providences was, for the prophets of old time,
     announcing as they did the future vision of Almighty God, to see
     Him, see both the Father and the Son, not properly, but :

     "so far as might practise and mould men's thoughts to receive
     that glory, which is hereafter to be revealed to all who love God.
     For not by discourse alone did the Fathers prophesy, but by vision,
     and conversation, and acts which they wrought, after the suggestion
     of the Spirit. In this sense then they beheld the invisible God :
     ... in this sense again they beheld the Son of God, who is Man,
     conversing with men; ... and the several progressive portions of
     that work by which He sums up all, they partly beheld in vision,
     declared partly in words, and partly signified as in type by action
     ; with their eyes beholding what God would have seen, by their
     discourse proclaiming He would have heard, by their acts fulfilling
     what He would have done ; in all, as prophets delivering their
     message."

     (17.) The instance of revelation by action, which IrenÃ¦us selects,
     is the marriage of the prophet Hosea, one of the cases on which the
     adversaries had taken occasion to speak reproachfully^113.

     "Christ showed Himself to the prophets in their typical actions, so
     as by them to prefigure and show forth things to come. Thus the
     prophet Hosea took to him ;a wife of whoredoms;' by that
     act prophesying that the earth should commit great whoredom,
     departing from the Lord ; meaning the men who are on the earth ; and
     that out of such men God would be well pleased to take to Himself a
     Church, to be sanctified by participation of His Son, as she was
     sanctified by communion with the prophet."

     That which Scripture here affirms of the marriage of Hosea, viz.,
     both its mystical purport, and its having been contracted by Divine
     order, the Fathers consider to be implied generally in the histories
     of the marriages of Prophets and Patriarchs ; and surely they had
     warrant for their opinion, in St. Paul's commentary on the
     narrative concerning Abraham and Hagar, which is quoted by Origen
     (amongst others) for this argument^114 :

     "That Scriptural histories of brides and handmaids should be
     referred to the mystical meaning, is no doctrine of ours, but
     received of wise teachers from the beginning ; one of whom thus
     expressed himself, awakening the hearer's mind to the mystical
     sense, ;Tell me, ye that desire,'" &c., (quoting the whole
     passage:) and then be subjoins : "Whoever will take up the Epistle
     to the Galatians will know how the allegory is employed in what
     relates to the marriages [of the Patriarchs] and their unions with
     their handmaids ; not as though it were the purport of God's
     Word that we should imitate those who did so, in their external and
     bodily actions, but (as the disciples of Jesus use to call it) in
     their spiritual ones."

     (18.) These remarks of some of the most considerable Fathers may
     serve perhaps both to explain and vindicate the judgment of the
     ancient Church on certain parts of the sacred history. The result of
     their rule is, that whenever an action startling to our moral sense
     is recorded of any of the holy men of old, more especially, when it
     is accompanied with, circumstances which clearly as a Mystery or
     Sacrament of religion, (the term Sacrament is used as commonly
     applied in Antiquity,) in such instances, (Scripture being silent as
     to the moral nature of the action), we cannot be sure that it was
     not either expressly commanded, like the sacrifice of Abraham, or at
     least prompted by inspiration of the Holy Ghost. It becomes us
     therefore not to criticise, but to adore.

     This idea in various degrees pervades the reflections of the Fathers
     on the case of Rebecca and Jacob, coming by subtlety, and taking
     away what Esau supposed to be his blessing. One writer indeed, St.
     Gregory Nazianzen, has spoken of it in terms of censure. He having
     somewhere occasion to magnify the value a parent's blessing,
     observes that^115, "one of the elder saints thought it worth
     obtaining even by stealth, deceiving his father by meat and the
     contrivance of a hairy garment: he pursued a noble object by ignoble
     means."

     But besides St. Gregory, it does not appear that any of the early
     Christian writers hesitated to consider the transaction in the same
     light, wherein it is represented by St. Augustin in the following
     passage^116 :

     "That which Jacob did by direction of his mother, so to appear to
     deceive his father, if you consider diligently and faithfully, non
     est mendacium sed mysterium. Which sort of thing, if we term it a
     lie, by the same rule all parables and figures must be also
     accounted lies. . . . But if we are not prepared to call it lying,
     whensoever words, signifying one thing through another are employed
     to communicate any truth ; it is clear that not only what Jacob said
     and did to obtain his father's blessing, but also the discourse
     of Joseph, whereby be seemed to beguile his brethren, and
     David's feigning madness, and other things of that kind, ought
     to be acquitted of the guilt of lying, and rather to be esteemed
     prophetic words and actions, to be referred [exclusively] to the
     truths which we were meant to understand by them."

     He regards the whole as a sort of scenery, (if the expression may be
     reverently used) not only excusable but praiseworthy in Rebecca, as
     being undertaken on intimation God's will.

     St. Ambrose says^117:

     "Rebecca for her part did not so much prefer one son to another, as
     the righteous to the unrighteous. For in the mind of that pious
     mother the mystery overweighed the tie of affection. She was not so
     much preferring Jacob to his brother, as offering him to the Lord,
     who, she knew, had power to preserve the gift presented unto him."

     This seems to mean that in consecrating Jacob to be the first born,
     she knowingly separated him from herself, and so made a great
     sacrifice. St. Ambrose adds:

     "Hereby, she provided also for Esau, withdrawing him as she did from
     the Divine displeasure, lest he should be involved in deeper guilt,
     by losing the grace of the benediction once received."

     These words mark strongly St. Ambrose's sense of what should
     call the sacramental nature of the transaction. In substance, that
     view is sanctioned also by St. Chrysostom. He says^118 :

     "Rebecca, did this not of her own mind, but in obedience to the
     divine oracle. What then? a man may say, did God co-operate with
     such a falsehood ? Nay, my brother, consider not simply what was
     done, but look to the purpose : that He did it not for any kind of
     worldly advantage, but sought to attract to himself his
     father's blessing. If we are always to look simply to the deed
     done, and not in every case to we shall have for the next thing to
     regard also the end, we shall have for the next thing to call
     Abraham an infanticide, and Phinehas a murderer. But not so ... for
     each of them was accomplishing a Divine decree. . . . Still more in
     this case your thoughts are not to dwell on the words of Jacob being
     formally a falsehood, but you are to understand that God, willing to
     bring His prediction to accomplishment, caused the whole so to take
     place by way of economy."

     So far St. Chrysostom, who proceeds to point out God's hand in
     many minute details of the transaction, such as Isaac's doubts
     being overruled; the special circumstance of his kissing Jacob, and
     limiting the blessing to him whom be kissed, as by a kind of
     sacramental sign; and not returning from the field until the economy
     was complete.

     St. Chrysostom, we see, dwells chiefly on the marks of providential
     interference in the literal transaction : others have brought out in
     a strong light the allegorical force of the things then said and
     done, from hints given incidentally in other parts of the Bible.
     Thus St. Ambrose^119, not indulging, his own, fancy, but following
     the tradition of an elder age of the Church : as appears plainly by
     St. Jerome's report of the commentary of Hippolytus^120 on this
     chapter of Genesis:

     "Jacob went to the flock, and brought for his father the offspring
     of innocency, or the gifts of sacred prophecy, because to the
     patriarch no food be knew could be more welcome than that Christ,
     who was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb to the
     sacrifice....The robe which he wore Rebecca brought out, in her
     character as prefiguring the Church, and assigned to her younger son
     the robe of the Old Testament, the prophetical and sacerdotal robe,
     the royal robe of David, the robe of the kings, Solomon, Hezekiah,
     Josiah ; she brought out and gave it to the Christian people, which
     would know how to use the favour received. For the Jewish people had
     it without use, and knew not of their own rich apparel. This robe
     was lying in the dimness, cast away and neglected. For it was
     obscured by the dark gloom of irreligion, and in the narrow heart of
     the Jewish people it could not be spread out wider. Christ's
     nation put it on and it shone forth ; illumined by the brightness of
     their faith and the light of their pious acts. Isaac recognised the
     order of his race, he knew the robe of the elder Scripture, but the
     voice of the elder people he did not recognise ; and thereby he
     gathered that there was change [of people.] For to this day the same
     robe remains, but a devouter nation hath arisen, and a confession
     clear and melodious ; well therefore said he, ;The voice is
     Jacob's voice, the hands are the hands of Esau.'"

     Augustine^121 adds the selection of the two kids ; "He bears the
     sins of others, and he bears them patiently, though they belong to
     others : for thus it is to wear the skins of the kids ; the kids
     being the scriptural symbol of the two sinful people ;" (and
     therefore one of the appointed sin offerings ;) "and Jacob wearing
     them to represent both Christ and His Church in that particular, the
     bearing of other men's burthens."

     He dwells also^122 much on Jacob's being declared just before
     to be a man without guile,

     "a p l a s t o z ; a significant expression leading one to infer
     that the subtlety so soon afterwards imputed to him was not subtlety
     in a bad sense : it was a figure of speech, as when Christ is called
     a Rock : it was no real fraud, as Jacob might truly say to his
     father, that for the purpose in question he was his elder son Esau ;
     for Esau had before made the agreement, sold his birthright, and put
     Jacob in his own place."

     Again^123, there is the conduct of Isaac, instead of being angry he
     trembled very exceedingly ; or as in the LXX. e x e s t h e k s t a
     s i n m e g a l h n s f o d r a : which kind of extasy, commonly
     happening in the revelation of great things, we are to understand
     that God gave him warning in his spirit to confirm the blessing to
     his younger son, who otherwise should have incurred anger by
     deceiving his father.

     Again^124, he kissed Jacob before he blessed him, and not Esau :
     confirming peace to the one and not to the other.

     (19.) These are the kind of circumstances, which, to the
     Fathers' view, betokened the special agency of the Most High in
     proceedings otherwise questionable, and which, as they thought,
     ought to turn censure into reverence. It will be seen that they are
     reducible to three heads ; first, approbation of analogous conduct
     in Scripture itself, such as Origen produces, in the case of Hagar ;
     secondly, tokens of special providence in the particular transaction
     such as occurred to Chrysostom. in the history of Jacob ; thirdly,
     the use of known symbolical imagery, as marking intended adaptation
     to the Christian mysteries; which head, as we have seen, may be
     largely illustrated from Augustin and Ambrose on the same case.

     It may be added, that they regarded themselves as especially bound
     to notice everything of this kind,---to be than commonly afraid
     to censure,---in treating of the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and
     Jacob. On passing from their history to that of others, Augustin, it
     will be found, changes his tone, so far as to be less positive in
     his vindications where the Scripture is silent. The reason is
     implied in the sentence which forms the transition^125. "Thus much
     concerning the three fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whose God
     He willed Himself to be called, Who is our

     Whom the Catholic Church worships." The Church had from the
     beginning to regard them as the chosen representatives of the Head
     Christ Jesus, and of the Body, the Church. God was not ashamed to be
     called their God ; they were in a peculiar sense the types of His
     chosen, His saints ; it was wise, and safe, and dutiful, to hold
     them in especial reverence. With this view^126, IrenÃ¦us, e. g, has
     expounded the whole history of Jacob ; of that one among the three,
     whose right to such honour the disputers of this world would be most
     apt to question.

     (20.) In other cases, as might be expected, their scrupulousness and
     reverence were mainly in proportion to their sense of the mystical
     meaning. Thus where it is written of Noah, e p i e n e k t o u o i n
     o u , k a i e m e q u s q h , k a i e g u m n w q h , e n t v o i k
     w a u t o u , they had no thoughts other than those of deepest
     reverence, considering not only what is so obvious, that the whole
     was involuntary through ignorance on the Patriarch's part, on
     which many of them argue largely^127 ; but also that which St.
     Cyprian writes, not in the tone of the ingenious inventor, but of
     one who had received it from tradition ecclesiastical^128.

     "We find, in Genesis, in the Case of Noah, an image of our
     Lord's Passion : that he drank of the wine, that he was drunken
     ; that he was naked in his own house; that he lay with his limbs
     bare and extended ; that the nakedness was pointed out by his second
     son, and reported abroad, but covered by the other two, the elder
     and the younger: and other particulars not to our present purpose."

     With the case of Lot and his daughters, as might be expected, they
     deal in a much more doubtful tone ; assigning as one reason the
     comparative imperfection of his character, and intimating a doubt
     (at least such is Origen's view^129) whether this can be
     reckoned among those narratives which prefigure Christ's sacred
     economy. At the same time they are exact in pointing out the
     probability (to which the air of the narrative certainly would lead
     us) that the women acted under the supposition of the whole world
     besides themselves and their father having been destroyed by the
     fire and brimstone. "They suspected," says Origen^130, "that some
     such thing had happened as they had heard of in the days of Noah,
     and they alone with their father were left for the renovation of the
     human race."

     (21.) This interpretation (in which many of the old writers^131
     agree), while it shows that they, contrary to some people's
     statements, used their common sense in applying to sacred history
     the ordinary distinctions and measures of right and wrong, exhibits
     also a clear instance of that other characteristic, which, as was
     before said, causes them in all their discussions to take the
     favourable side, to a degree which to many moderns has appeared
     extravagant :---their deep sense of the Communion of Saints, as a
     relation really subsisting between them and the Patriarchs and
     Prophets, and not merely as a figure of speech. It should seems as
     if this feeling were the natural growth of the other, viz., of the
     reverential consciousness of God's own immediate presence,
     over-ruling the Patriarchs' conduct in such a way, as to make
     the whole a series of links, binding the old dispensations to the
     new. Those who really contemplated the matter so, must have looked
     on Noah, Abraham, Jacob, and the rest, as sharers with them in the
     same Sacraments ; not only as spiritual Fathers by the example of
     their faith, but also (since Christ's coming) as brethren in
     His grace. The duty therefore of lenity of supposition, the command
     to impute no evil, would hold in their case with peculiar force ;
     becoming as it did the more affecting, by the sense that it was
     demanded not for the living but for the dead ; and the more serious
     and awful, by the knowledge, that for ought they could tell,
     God's own hand and counsel might be more or less in the things
     which, they were blaming.

     (22.), For these reasons we find the Fathers, constantly even where
     the Mystical meaning was entirely concealed from them, or where they
     gave it no direct consideration---we find them checking to the
     utmost all inclination to censure the holy men of old without
     express authority. The principle is laid down by IrenÃ¦us, in words
     the more worthy of every believer's attention, in that he
     utters them not as his own, but as the words of a certain Presbyter,
     who had heard them from the eye-witnesses and scholars of the
     Apostles. IrenÃ¦us, having stated it as one of the marks of a sound
     teacher, that "he, expounds the Scriptures to us without peril,
     neither blaspheming God, nor dishonouring Patriarchs, nor despising
     Prophets," goes on to record the following, as an apostolical
     tradition^132 : "That for the old Fathers, concerning those things
     which they wrought without the counsel of the Spirit, that censure
     is sufficient which the Scripture itself contains. God is no
     respecter of persons :---to things not done according to His
     will, He himself annexed that censure which was convenient." He
     instances at large in the cases of David and Solomon, concerning
     whom, he adds^133, "the aforesaid Presbyter affirmed that the rebuke
     of Holy Writ was sufficient ; that no flesh might glory in the
     presence of the Lord."

     The next sentence, whatever some may think of the statement,
     contained in it, is at least a mark of the ancient Church's
     anxiety to assert for the Patriarchs, as was just now observed, a
     part in the Communion of Saints.

     "For this cause, that ancient Presbyter went on to say, the Lord
     descended to the regions under the earth, declaring to them also the
     good tidings of His advent ; remission of sins being appointed for
     them only who believe. Now those believed in Him, whosoever were
     hoping in Him, i.e. those who foretold His coming, and did the work
     of His mysterious providences, righteous men, and Prophets, and
     Patriarchs. Their sins He forgave as He did ours : which sins,
     therefore, it becomes us not any more to lay to their charge ;
     except we think scorn the grace of God .. For all men need the glory
     of God, and are justified not of themselves but by the coming of the
     Lord : those I mean who look steadily on His light.

     "He taught moreover that their acts were written for our reproof,
     that we might know this first, that there is one God, both ours and
     theirs, whom sins cannot please, though wrought by renowned persons.
     Next, we might keep ourselves from evil things. For if those elders
     who went before us in God's special graces, for whom the son of
     God had not yet suffered, were visited with such disgrace, if they
     transgressed in some one thing, and became slaves to fleshly
     concupiscence ; what shall this generation suffer, as many as have
     despised the coming of the Lord, and turned utter slaves to their
     own pleasures! . ;We ought not then,' said that Presbyter,
     ;to be proud, nor to reproach the ancients, but ourselves to
     fear, lest haply after the knowledge of Christ, if we do any thing
     which pleases not God, we no longer have remission of our sins, but
     find ourselves shut out of His kingdom'"

     A little farther on he produces the authority of that same Presbyter
     for this sentiment^134 :

     "As on account of those sins which the Scriptures themselves lay to
     charge of the Patriarchs and Prophets, we are not to reproach them,
     nor become like Ham, who derided his father's shame and fell
     under the curse ; but rather to thank God for them, that their sins
     were forgiven them in the coming of our Lord : even as they, he
     said, give thanks, and are glorified in our salvation :---So
     concerning those deeds which the Scriptures, reprove not at all, but
     simply relate them, we ought not, he said, to become accusers, (for
     we are not more exact, than God, neither can we be above our Master)
     but we ought to look out, for the spiritual meaning. For whatsoever
     things are set down in the Scriptures without censure, not one of
     them is idly set down, nor without meaning."

     And then^135 he gives the example of Lot and his daughters, adopting
     (it is not IrenÃ¦us, observe, but the apostolical Presbyter) that
     interpretation which Origen, as we have seen, doubted of as too
     favourable. A thing much to be remarked by those, who think little
     of the Mystical method, as supposing it a, figment of Platonism, or
     a contrivance of a later school in the Church.

     A signal example of the mildness above inculcated had been given by
     the same IrenÃ¦us a little before^136, in arguing against Tatian,
     who denied the possibility of Adam's salvation. He contrasts
     Adam's proceedings even after his fall with those of the Evil
     Spirit, and says,

     "It was another who seduced him under pretence of immortality : and
     being seduced, he presently fears, and hides himself ; not as though
     he could escape God, but in his confusion, because having
     transgressed His command,, he is unworthy to come to the sight or
     speech of God. Now the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
     understanding : the understanding of sin causes penitence : and to
     the penitent God vouchsafes His mercy. Moreover, by his girdle or
     apron he manifested his penitence in the way of significant action :
     . . . . as though he had said, ;By disobedience I have lost
     that robe of holiness which I had from the Holy Spirit : I now
     aknowledge that I deserve that sort of vesture, which can give no
     pleasure, but galls and vexes the body.' And this dress
     evidently he would always have worn, humbling himself, had not God
     who is merciful clothed them with coats of skins instead of the fig
     leaves."

     Another case very much in point is their view of the conduct of
     Abraham in Egypt, making known Sarah as his sister, not as his wife
     : it was no falsehood, as he himself explained afterwards, and, that
     there was in it no unfaithful timidity, Augustin^137 argues on this
     ground that :

     "it is a sound precept, when a man has any resource, not to tempt
     the Lord his God : and that our Saviour Himself set an example to
     that purpose, both by flying into Egypt in his childhood, and by
     going up to a certain feast not openly but as it were in secret....
     So Abraham among strangers, because of the exceeding, beauty of
     Sarah finding himself in a double danger, both of her honour and her
     husband's life, and not being able to protect both, but having
     it in his power to do something for one of the two, i.e. his own
     life; that he might not, tempt his God, he took what precaution he
     could; and where he could do nothing, that cause he committed to his
     God."

     One may observe in passing, that the suspicion of any particular
     want of faith in Abraham on that occasion is greatly lessened by
     what he afterwards told Abimelech^138 : that the concealment of his
     marriage was not a measure to which they were driven by the present
     alarm, but one which they had constantly used by way of precaution
     since they first set out on their pilgrimage.

     (23.) Elsewhere the rule of favourable construction is applied,
     where the act is allowed to he censurable, with a view to
     mitigation, not entire acquittal. Thus Aaron is conjectured by
     Augustin^139 to have proposed to the Israelites the breaking off
     their earrings, with a view to withdraw them by the hardness of the
     command from their idolatrous intention. Thus Theodoret^140,
     relating the oversight of Moses in striking the rock, insists
     carefully on the many circumstances which might seem according to
     human measures to render an expression of impatience for the moment
     completely venial.

     "They (Moses and Aaron) being out of heart at their sister's
     death, the people set on them, mutinying for want of water ; they,
     therefore, impatient at such extreme unruliness, used words of
     equivocal meaning on bringing out the water, ;Must we fetch you
     water out of this rock ?' in a tone as if he doubted, so great
     was his wrath with them. It was, however, a doubt not of the soul
     but of the lips only : for so the Greek Bible expresses it, d i e s
     t e i l e n , he made a distinction, or hesitated, with his lips."

     Theodoret adds: "However, we must not forget that God pronounced
     this sentence (of exclusion from the promised land) with a view to
     another dispensation which He was carrying on." Here we see plainly
     the studious apologist : yet who can deny that the tone is right and
     scriptural?

     (24.) The same lenity of supposition is sometimes extended to the
     conduct of persons, concerning whose general character Scripture is
     either silent, or at first sight might appear condemnatory. Thus of
     Rachel stealing her father's images, Theodoret writes^141 :

     "Some say, Rachel stole them out of an affection she still
     entertained for them ; I, quite on the contrary, suppose that,
     desiring to free her father from superstition, she did, as it were,
     make prize of them : for of her general piety we are certified by
     the divine Scripture."

     Having confirmed this by several texts, he proceeds to suggest a
     prophetic meaning.

     "Jacob was a type of the, Lord of all : for, as God had two
     peoples,---the elder, having a veil upon its heart, the younger,
     endowed with the beauty of faith ; even so Jacob, two wives, Leah,
     tender eyed, Rachel, beautiful and well-favoured ; the elder with
     many children, the younger barren : for the Church also of the
     Gentiles of old was barren, but became afterwards very fruitful. .
     Since then, the Church, upon faith in God our Saviour, pulled up by
     the roots the error of her forefathers, Rachel, being a type of that
     Church, stole the idols of her father, that herein also she might
     offer a dim shadow of the truth."

     Here one is tempted to remark, how much we may lose by the cold, and
     dry way, in which we are apt to read the sacred history, as mere
     matter of criticism, historical, or moral, contrasted with the high
     and thrilling views, wherewith the ecclesiastical rules of
     interpretation reward those who fairly adopt them.

     Other instances of the like lenity, applied even to persons more
     clearly in the wrong, may be found in Theodoret^142 on the histories
     of Thamar, the daughter-in-law of Judah, and of the Bethel^143
     Prophet, whose advice caused the death of the messenger sent to
     Jeroboam.

     (25.) A fortiori, one should expect the like mildness in the
     comments of Antiquity on the New Testament. One instance may be here
     given, because it relates to a matter which is and has been much
     misinterpreted: St. Paul's condescension in the matter of
     certain Jewish observances. St. Augustin exclaims^144 :

     " God forbid that we should account him to have done this
     deceitfully. For on this subject his sentence is well known ; that
     neither such Jews as then believed in Christ should be forbidden the
     traditions of their fathers, nor the Gentiles, on becoming
     Christians, be forced to observe the same : lest on the one hand
     those holy mysteries, which were known to rest on the Divine
     command, should come to be shunned as profanations,---on the
     other, to be accounted necessary to salvation for all who turned to
     God under the New Testament. . . . . St. Paul's saying,
     therefore, ;I am made all things to all men,' tells us
     what he did in the way of sympathy, not in the way of deceitful
     accommodation. . . . . . He is made as a Jew to the Jews, not by
     deceiving them, but by putting himself, in thought, in their place
     and mind."

     (26.) Thus far by way of illustration of the two chief principles,
     by which antiquity seems to have been guided, in commenting on the
     startling and painful portions of the history of God's ancient
     people. One more general observation remains : it is a negative
     statement, and requires a much larger induction than at present it
     professes to rest upon ; but it is submitted to the judgment of
     those who are really versed in ancient theology, Whether the Fathers
     do in any case plead the Mystical meaning of a transaction as any
     excuse for it, granting it indeed immoral. The Mystery comes in, to
     show that God's hand was in what took place, and often, among
     other circumstances, may lead to the supposition of an express
     command from God, and so may indirectly tend to do away with the
     immorality : but the whole tone of their commentaries indicates, and
     sometimes they expressly disavow, any thought of palliating guilt by
     the simple fact of the action being afterwards found typical. Thus
     St. Augustin^145, examining in order the cavils of the ManichÃ¦ans,
     against one narrative after another, premises in every case his
     literal defence or explanation, before be touches the sacramental or
     mysterious meaning. Thus Theodoret^146, although as firmly as any
     one adhering to the mystical mode of exposition, advances in
     mitigation those circumstances only, which may be gathered from the
     letter, in such histories as those of Noah, Lot, and Thamar. Thus
     even St. Ambrose, who seems to have been most passionately carried
     away by his admiration of the elder saints, and most afraid to
     exercise any judgment of his own upon their conduct---and who in
     his second Apology for David, to which may be added some expressions
     about the incest of Judah, comes, perhaps, as near as any writer to
     a questionable plea from the mystical interpretation, as though it
     in some degree palliated the sin,---even he, we shall find, does
     not enter on the consideration of the Mystery at all, before he has
     used considerations drawn from the literal history to adjust the
     degree of censure required by the case^147.

     (27.) If we pass from these indications of caution, to express
     disavowals by the Fathers of immoral use of the mystical principle,
     we meet with one in St. Ambrose himself^148, remarking on the
     conduct of Aaron, in assisting the Israelites to make an idol.

     "That renowned High Priest we can neither acquit, nor yet dare we
     altogether condemn him. However, he was not without a special
     meaning in taking away the rings and jewels of the Jews ; for they
     who were plotting sacrilege could not have the seal of faith."

     Thus St. Ambrose : and his scholar St. Augustin repeats the same
     caution many times. For example^149 :

     "The conduct of Lot and his daughters we do not justify, on the
     ground of its having had a meaning, whereby it foretold the
     perverseness of some in future times. Their purpose in so acting was
     one, God's purpose in permitting such actions, with a view to
     certain typical instruction, another ; His just judgment abiding the
     while on the sin of the persons then living, and His providence
     watchfully securing the mystical representation of others to come
     long after. The deed then related in Holy Scripture is a prophecy
     considered in their conduct who performed it, it is a crime."

     Again, in speaking, of the incest of the patriarch Judah: the truth
     of the spiritual meaning, he says, and the criminality of the act,
     may well stand together^150.

     "The conduct of Judah, in regard of his unbridled passion, was evil,
     but without his knowledge it presignified an exceeding good : and
     let this caution stand for all other evil deeds of men, whereby He
     who records their history hath seen fit to prophesy good to us."

     (28.) It is not of course pretended that the Fathers acted in all
     cases up to their own rule : so many of them, writing so
     miscellaneously, all of like passions with us. But it is believed
     that the rules above illustrated will go a good way towards
     explaining the difference between their theology and ours, in what
     may be called the casuistry of the historical Scriptures. And we,
     perhaps, should read Bible history to more advantage, if we tried to
     keep the same principles in view ; the principle, namely, of
     reverencing throughout the mysterious connexion of that history,
     even the most startling portions of it, with the Economy of our
     Salvation by the Son of God: and the principle of entire respect for
     the Saints of the Old Covenant fearing to censure them where
     Scripture is silent ; welcoming all reasonable topics of mitigation
     even where they are clearly blameable; never rudely sitting in
     judgment on them, but looking up to them as to elder brethren, who
     might of course err, but whom it is no part of ours to reprove,
     feeling as we must in every part of their history, read by the light
     of Christian faith, that we are even now with them in the more
     immediate presence of our common Lord and Father.

     It may be, that thus our notions may remain unsettled, on many
     actions recorded in the Bible ; of which we would gladly know what
     to think, both for our own and other men's satisfaction. What
     then? it is one of the tokens of true theology, to acknowledge
     doubtfulness and perplexity, more or less, in every subject. A
     religious man would not think himself at liberty to question
     God's moral government, because of the embarrassment
     continually occasioned by the inconsistencies of the good, and the
     general difficulty of discerning men's real character ; how
     then dare any one positively insist on full satisfaction in his view
     of the conduct of God's Saints? As it is, the doubtfulness of
     many things has this advantage, sufficient to outweigh much
     annoyance ; that it lessens the apparent difference between the
     scenes of Scripture and common life ; lessens the temptation to
     forget how near God is to us; helps us to feel our true condition,
     as full of supernatural wonders, could we but realize them, as ever
     was and patriarchs of old.

     Moreover, the habit of thus considering Scripture will prove in some
     respects an important doctrinal safeguard. The Saints (be it spoken
     with all reverence) were types of the Almighty ; their conduct in
     many respects analogous to His economies ; and if we use ourselves
     to speak or think of them hastily and irreverently, the transition
     will be found less violent than some might imagine, to irreverent
     ways of speaking and thinking of Him. Those who can bring themselves
     to talk superciliously, and judge by mere modern measures, of the
     conduct of Abraham or Jacob, or of the destruction of the
     Canaanites, are perhaps in a way to question the reality of the
     Atonement, or the eternity of the wrath to come.

     Lastly, the same considerations may prove available, in some
     material parts of discipline, devotional and moral ;---teaching
     us to acquiesce with things which we cannot account for, in the
     conduct of those who are more experienced, in God's service
     than ourselves, and especially assisting us to recognize the
     overruling Arm, even in the worst excesses and perversions of men,
     and to take all tranquilly, knowing from whom it comes.

     The subject which will naturally come next in order, is the
     Fathers' application of the Mystical Principle to the
     exposition of the New Testament.

     Â§ v.---Ancient Mysticism as applied to the Interpretation of New
                                  Testament.

     The object of this section is, allowing the fact, that the ancient
     interpreters did apply the mystical principle very largely to the
     New Testament, to point out some of the rules by which they
     conducted that process, the limits within which they confined it,
     and the good purposes, which, under such rules and limits it was
     calculated to answer.

     But the very mention of mystical interpretation, as applied the
     Christian Scriptures, suggests in limine a plausible objection,
     which it may be as well to anticipate in some measure, before
     proceeding any further. It may and will be said, "Whatever one may
     think of the degree and manner in which they allegorized the Old
     Testament, all must allow that to a certain extent they were borne
     out by Scripture in so doing. But to allegorize the New Testament at
     all, what is it but turning the substance into a shadow, and by
     consequence unsettling the very foundations of the religion ?" Those
     accordingly, who wish to be very severe upon the Fathers, have
     thought proper, in treating of this head, to make mention of the
     wild and cloudy dreams of the early Quakers^151, and other modern
     enthusiasts ; as if the two things admitted some kind of comparison.

     Again, taking another point of view, it may be argued that such a
     line of interpretation coincides too nearly with that which St. Paul
     so earnestly deprecates in the Epistle to the Galatians. This, it
     may be said, is the very essence of the Law, that it had but a
     shadow of good things to come. By allegorizing the Gospel, you are
     so far making it also a shadow ; and what is but going back to the
     Law, and incurring at once all the anathemas which the zealous
     Apostle pronounces on all such disturbers of Christian perfection

     This way of objecting would be as just as it sounds plausible, if
     either the truth of the New Testament history, or what we may call
     the completeness of the dispensation, were impugned by the mystical
     interpretations current in antiquity. But such is by no means the
     case. As to the truth of the history ; something was said in a
     former section, to shew that even Origen and his followers who are
     most censurable on that head, never thought of denying or doubting
     the main facts ; and that even where they speak most freely of minor
     details, as though the apparent discrepancies of the evangelical
     narrative could only be reconciled by supposing an admixture of
     allegory, it is not so much real contradiction, which they impute to
     the sacred historians, as an appearance of contradiction, which they
     assume to be intended and providential.

     Again, as to the other point, of completeness ; the danger of
     sweeping negatives is proverbial, yet I suppose one might safely
     challenge the production from any orthodox writer, or from any of
     the school of Origen who had not been condemned as a heretic, of a
     single passage, tending to make out the Gospel scheme imperfect, in
     the sense here alleged,---Judaically imperfect---a shadow and
     forerunner of better things to come even on this earth ; or as any
     other than the last and best of God's appointed ways of
     preparing His banished for restoration. Those blasphemies were
     reserved for such as Manes and Mahomet, and for that kind of
     infidelity, so current in our days, which allowing that the Gospel
     was well enough in its time, expects more however, in this and in
     coming generations, from the spirit of the age, than from the Spirit
     of the Church. We do not find even Origen's licentious
     disciples who incurred Church censures in the fifth general council,
     stigmatized with any opinion of the kind.

     History then does not warrant our attributing either of the supposed
     ill tendencies to the mystical way of expounding the New Testament ;
     and a little consideration will show that in reason and argument
     they are quite separable from it : as will be presently evident, on
     proceeding to inquire calmly, what this Mysticism, which has such an
     ill name, really amounts to ; and on what great principles it is
     grounded.

     (2.) The nature and amount of it may be best understood, by
     producing a few examples ; which will serve also incidentally to
     shew, how early it prevailed in the Church of God, and by what high
     authorities it was undoubtingly sanctioned. Hear, for instance, St.
     Clement of Alexandria, descanting on the circumstances of the
     parable of the Good Samaritan. "Which of the three," says our Lord,
     "was neighbour to the sufferer?" The other answering, "He that
     showed mercy on him;" Says Clement^152 :

     "Who then is our neighbour, rather than the Saviour Himself ? To
     whom, rather than to Him, are we indebted for pity, all but
     slaughtered as we were by the rulers of darkness of this world, with
     so many wounds, with fears, desires, angers, griefs, deceits,
     pleasures ? Of all these wounds the only healer is Jesus, cutting
     out entirely every passion by the roots, not as the Law did, the
     produce merely, the fruits of the pernicious plants, but laying His
     own axe to the roots of iniquity. This is He who pours the wine, the
     blood of the vine of David, into our wounded souls ; who from the
     tender mercies of the Father brings oil, and that in abundance :
     this is He who makes known to us the indissoluble bands of health
     and salvation ; charity, faith, hope ; this is He who hath enjoined
     angels and authorities and powers to minister to us for a great
     reward : i. e. for the deliverance which themselves also shall
     receive from the vanity of the world at the revelation of the glory
     of the Sons of God."

     Besides the main lesson or moral of the parable, he assumes it to be
     full of designed allusions (and surely as he exhibits them they are
     very beautiful allusions) to the mystery of the Gospel, the process
     of our salvation by Christ. Neither would it be safe to attribute
     this to the play of Clement's own imagination, or to the manner
     of the Alexandrian school. For we find the same turn given to the
     parable by IrenÃ¦us, a far graver and less diffuse writer, and
     trained in a remote part of the Church, where there is no cause to
     believe that the writings of Philo or other Jewish mystics had any
     particular influence. IrenÃ¦us, the disciple of'Polycarp, argues
     thus on a circumstance of this parable^153.

     "The dew of God [the Holy Ghost] is necessary to us, that we be not
     scorched nor made unfruitful, and that where we have an accuser,
     there also we may have an advocate [Paracletum] : For the Lord
     commends to the Holy Ghost that man of His who had fallen among
     thieves, whom Himself pitied, and bound up his wounds ; him Christ
     commends to the care of the Holy Spirit, giving two pence, of royal
     coinage : in order, that we, who receive by the Spirit the image and
     inscription of the Father and the Son, may improve the penny
     committed to us, accounting for it with manifold increase to our
     Lord."

     It will be perceived that IrenÃ¦us is even more express than Clement
     in sanctioning the allegorical exposition of this parable.
     Clement's language might be accounted for, by supposing him
     merely to be indulging in a vein of half poetical allusion ; but
     IrenÃ¦us produces his exposition as a theological argument against
     an error of the Gnostics ; a part of whose creed was that the Aeon
     Christ descended on the Man Jesus at His Baptism. In opposition to
     which, St. IrenÃ¦us, maintaining, of course, that it was the Holy
     Spirit which so descended, proceeds to show by many scriptural
     arguments, how comfortable that circumstance was to the office
     assigned to the Comforter in the economy of salvation : e. g. to His
     regenerating influence in Baptism ; to the miracle of Pentecost, as
     fulfilling the promise of our Lord ; to the images of water, and
     dew, under which He is repeatedly described ; and, for his last
     instance he adduces, as we have seen, the circumstance of the good
     Samaritan on his departure committing the rescued traveller to
     another's care, until Himself should return ; this IrenÃ¦us
     brings forward as a known and acknowledged type or the office of the
     Holy Ghost, so well known and acknowledged, as to warrant him in
     reasoning from it to the interpretation of disputed passages.

     So early, and in such high quarters, do we find warrant for
     considering our Lord's parables, with a view not only to the
     immediate moral of each, but also to certain hints of things future
     or supernatural, which even their minute details are supposed to
     convey ; which is one considerable branch of New Testament
     Mysticism.

     (3.) Another, and a yet more extensive one, relates not to His
     words, but to His conduct. It consists in tracing through details,
     apparently indifferent, of what befel our Divine Master on earth,
     providential illustrations of His dealings with His people, or of
     their future fortunes, trials, and behaviour. To take an instance,
     which occurs not seldom, and is met with very early : the minute
     enumeration, varying in the different Evangelists, of the
     circumstances attending His last entry into Jerusalem. Justin
     Martyr, in his dialogue with Tryphon, writes thus of a part of the
     dying prophecy of Jacob^154.

     "The expression, ;binding his foul, to the vine, and his
     ass's colt to the choice vine,' was a foreshowing of the
     works wrought in His first coming, and of the Gentiles also, who
     were to believe in Him. For these as a foal that had never borne a
     burden, nor taken any yoke upon his neck, until such time as this
     our Christ came, and sent His disciples, and made them followers of
     His own. Then they submitted to the yoke of His word, and bowed
     their backs to endure all things, for the blessing's sake which
     they waited for, and which he had foretold. And in fact, there was a
     certain she-ass with her colt, bound at the entrance of a certain
     village by name Bethphage, which our Lord Jesus Christ, on the point
     of entering Jerusalem, commanded His disciples to bring to Him and
     sitting thereon, He made His entry into the city. Which being
     notoriously done by Him, according to what had been prophesied of
     the future doings of Christ, made it evident that He was the
     Christ.. . . But as to the circumstance, that the Prophetic Spirit
     agrees with the Patriarch Jacob, in mentioning the ass before
     accustomed to the yoke, as well as her colt,... as also that He
     Himself enjoined His disciples, as I said before, to bring both
     animals ; these things were a prophetic intimation to those also of
     your synagogue, who should concur with certain of the Gentiles in
     believing on Him. For as the colt unharnessed was a sign to those of
     the Gentiles, so also to those of your people the she-ass under her
     burthen. For the law given you by the Prophets is as a burthen laid
     on you."

     (4.) The same interpretation is mentioned by Origen ; accompanying
     it however, as his manner is, with a conjecture of his own, which on
     the whole he seems to prefer. He writes^155 :

     "I know that some have interpreted the ass tied, to be the believers
     of the Circumcision, released from many bonds by those who truly and
     spiritually had become disciples of the Word. The colt, on the other
     hand, they expound to be the Gentile believers, who were at large
     before they received the doctrine of Jesus, and who in respect of
     their unbridled and self-pleasing ways, might be regarded as having
     shaken off every yoke. These expounders have omitted the
     circumstance of the multitude going before and following. However,
     one might perhaps, with some plausibility, make the former answer to
     Moses and the prophets, the latter to the Holy Apostles, entering
     all together into some mystical Jerusalem ;"

     The meaning of which he next proceeds to point out.

     The whole passage may serve as an instructive specimen of the
     difference between Origen and the generality of the Fathers. The
     exposition which he produces as second best, is evidently that in
     which the Church commonly acquiesced ; as may further appear from
     the sanction afterwards given to it both by Ambrose and
     Augustin---Ambrose thus expressing himself^156. "Well is it
     written, ;on which never man sate ;' since none ever
     before Christ ever called the Gentile nations into the Church."
     Augustin again, speaking as of an allowed point^157 :

     "By the ass's colt on which never man had sat, we understand
     the people of the Gentiles, who had not received the law of the
     Lord. By the she-ass, (since both beasts were brought to the Lord)
     that portion of His congregation which came from the people of
     Israel ; not altogether untamed, but such as to have known her
     master's crib."

     But Origen, not contented with this prophetical interpretation the
     event in question, states also as possible, and recommends as on the
     whole preferable, the following moral interpretation of same : which
     however he advances (it is but justice to him to remark it) with
     expressions denoting unaffected reverence and modesty^158. He
     conjectures:

     "Jesus is the Word of God, entering into the soul, here called
     Jerusalem, borne on the she-ass which His disciples had loosed from
     her bonds : i. e. on the uncorrupt writings of the Old Testament
     expounded by the disciples, whose business it is to solve them, and
     who are two in number : i. e. the two kinds of mystical
     interpretation, moral and the prophetical : the one referring all
     things that are written to the healing of the soul, and with that
     view allegorizing them ; the other exhibiting the good and true
     things to come, through those set before us in shadow. But He rides
     also the young colt, the New Testament ; (for in both we may the
     word of truth,) to purify us, and expel those thoughts which buy and
     sell within us. And into Jerusalem, the soul, He enters not alone,
     nor yet with some few only ; for many things must take place in us
     to go before the Word of God, which protects us, and very many to
     follow Him ; all however hymning and praising Him, and spreading
     under Him their own array and vesture, that those which are His
     vehicles may not touch the earth, while He deigns to abide on them,
     who came down from Heaven."

     Such is Origen's descant on this part of our Lord's
     history : into which he was probably led, as was before hinted, by
     his wish to preserve as much as might be of the moral mysticism of
     Philo and others, in addition, not in preference, to the kind of
     allegory more properly Christian. Whatever may be thought of the
     general principle, it will perhaps be allowed, that in this instance
     it is beautifully applied, and may remind us of one of the Advent
     Hymns of Bishop Taylor^159.

     (5.) The arguments too are not contemptible by which Origen in the
     first instance vindicates the looking out for some mystical meaning
     in this passage^160.

     "I should like to ask those who think that nothing beyond the
     literal history was in St. Matthew's mind when writing his
     Gospel, what was the urgent necessity of sending the two disciples
     into the village over against Bethphage, to find and loose the ass
     tied and the colt with her, and bring them to Jesus. What was there
     especially worth recording in the fact that our Lord sat on the ass
     and colt, and so entered into the city ? . . . If the prophecy of
     Zechariah merely predict the outward and bodily event as narrated by
     the evangelists, let us see how those who stay themselves on the
     letter keep entire the connecting thread of the prophecy ; what they
     make of the passage immediately following, about cutting off the
     chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, &c. (an argument,
     [he adds] wherewith the Jews press us not slightly.) . . . They
     cannot say that the two animals were needed on account of the length
     of the way, that being only fifteen furlongs. . . . Nor do I suppose
     that it suits well with the majesty of the Son's Divinity, to
     say that so great a Being avowed Himself to have need of an ass tied
     and a colt with her."

     There are other particulars which he mentions : but these may
     suffice for a specimen of the kind of criticism, by which the
     allegorical method was supported, when it began to be called in
     question : which does not appear to have been until Origen's
     time ; the attack being most likely provoked by his incautious use
     of it. Certainly there seems to be a good deal of weight in such
     points of detail as he here alleges, not so much in behalf of his
     particular interpretation, as in establishing the general fact, that
     some spiritual meaning lies hid in these things ; and if in them,
     then by parity of reasoning in other narratives, the particulars of
     which are (speaking humanly) as unaccountable as in this instance.

     (6.) It may be worth while to add on this head one passage from
     Tertullian, as a striking example of the manner, in which those
     primitive readers of the New Testament caught up things which we
     esteem casual and transient, and improved them to spiritual
     purposes. He is showing how full Scripture is of allusions to the
     doctrine of Salvation by Water, and thus he sums up the incidental
     evidence of the Gospel history on that subject^161.

     "Christ is found never without Water; since Himself also is baptized
     in Water. It is by Water, at a marriage feast, that He makes what
     may be called the first inaugural essay of His power. In His
     discourse He invites the thirsty to that Water which is His, and
     eternal. Teaching of charity, He selects among works of kindness for
     special approbation, a cup of Water offered to a brother. It is by a
     Well that He recruits His strength ; He walks on the Water, as
     though of set purpose ; He [repeatedly] passes the Lake ; He
     ministers Water to His disciples ; nay, His testimony concerning
     baptism lasts even to His passion ; when He is surrendered to
     crucifixion, Water comes in---witness the hands of Pilate ; when
     He is wounded, Water bursts from His side---witness the spear of
     the soldier."

     (7.) To this head belong the many spiritual allusions, which the
     ancient commentators seem to themselves to find, in the Names of
     places and persons, throughout our Lord's history. The prin-
     ciple on which they proceeded is laid clown in a fragment of St.
     Clement of Alexandria^162.

     "When we are accurately searching the Scriptures, since it is
     acknowledged that they are written in parables, we ought by the
     names to trace out those notions of the things, which were so to
     speak, in the mind of the Holy Ghost, and which He there teacheth,
     having stamped His own meaning on the words."

     And for this they seemed to find warrant, not only in the
     speculations of Pythagoras, (whom Clement quotes in illustration of
     his maxim,) and in the natural forebodings of mankind in general, as
     expressed in a well-known and very noble stanza of Aeschylus^163 ;
     but also still more in the history of the Old Testament, abounding
     as it does with names, both of persons and places, imposed (if one
     may so speak) sacramentally ; i. e. by way of token from the Most
     High of some future event, or hidden purpose. It probably seemed to
     Origen and those who followed him, but an extension of the same rule
     of interpretation, when they took pains (e. g.) to ascertain the
     Hebrew meaning of the names of the Baptist and his parents. He
     says^164 :

     "It may be profitable, as in many cases the true force of names is
     worth knowing, so in this place to consider the meaning of the names
     John and Zacharias : for as though it were a matter of no small
     consequence, at the time of naming him there was a providential
     interference."

     Then he proceeds to explain the three names :

     "John, i. e. grace from God, was born of Zacharias, i. e. the
     remembrance of God, according to the oath of our God, which is
     denoted by the name Elisabeth :"

     the three names together teaching that divine grace is the result of
     God's covenant blessing man's pious endeavours.

     (8.) This example relates to persons : it may be well to give
     another which relates to this names of places. Origen had noticed a
     various reading of the name Bethabara, where John was bap- tizing ;
     some copies write Bethania or Bethany, but Origen shews that this is
     geographically impossible, and follows up his argument, by
     remarking^165 :

     "The interpretation of the name [Bethabara] suits the baptism of one
     who was making ready a people prepared for the Lord ; for being
     translated it is, ;The House of Preparation :' whereas
     Bethany means, ;The House of Obedience.' For where else
     did it become him to baptize, who was sent as a messenger to prepare
     Christ's way before Him, than in the House of Preparation ? and
     what more suitable birthplace than the House of Obedience, for Mary,
     who chose the good part which could not be taken away from her ? for
     Martha, who was cumbered about waiting on Jesus ? and for their
     brother, who was called Friend by the Saviour ? He therefore who
     wishes to understand the Holy Writings without omission must not
     despise minute attention to names."

     Here, it will be perceived, be assumes his rule so entirely, as to
     think it of some consequence in settling the preference among
     various readings of the name of a place. And so just after^166,
     among other reasons for reading Gergesa instead of Gerasa or Gadara,
     as the scene of the miracle of the evil spirits and the herd of
     swine : He says :

     "The interpretation of Gergesa is, ;the abode of those who did
     cast out ;' perhaps named, by a prophetical instinct, from the
     way in which the Saviour was treated by those who besought Him to
     depart out of their coasts."

     The like interpretations abound in St. Jerome, an author little
     likely to be biassed in their favour by the example of Origen, but
     qualified for them as Origen was, by his knowledge of the Hebrew,
     the want of which is probably the reason of their occurring less
     frequently, if ever, in Ambrose and Augustin. One might specify in
     particular the elegant way in which he has introduced more than one
     of them in the letter to Eustochium, which contains the itinerary of
     her mother Paula. He represents Paula addressing Bethlehem as
     follows^167 :

     "Hail, Bethlehem, the House of Bread, wherein was born that Bread
     which cometh down from heaven. Hail, Ephrata, region most abundant
     and fruitful, the fertility whereof is God Himself."

     "Not^168 far from thence she went down to the tower of Ader, i. e.
     the dock; near which Jacob fed his flock, and the shepherds watching
     by night were counted worthy to hear, ;Glory to GOD in the
     highest.' Presently after, quickening her pace, she began to
     travel along the old way which leads to Gaza, i. e. to the power or
     riches of God ; when she thought of the Ethiopian eunuch."

     Again, on the passage of Jeremiah, he writes^169 :

     "Behold, I will send fishers and hunters, who shall hunt you out of
     every hill and mountain ; These are they whom the Lord sends out to
     fishing, and from fishers in the sea causes them to become fishers
     of men. Whence also the village of Peter and Andrew comes to be
     called by this name : for Bethsaida in our tongue is interpreted the
     House of Hunters."

     It will have been observed, that some of these instances of
     allegorical names are taken not from our Lord's own history,
     but from that of St. John the Baptist ; and it is certain that the
     Fathers generally consider all that happened to him, at least before
     our Lord's manifestation, as capable of and requiring an
     allegorical exposition : e. g. says Clement^170 :

     "The silence of Zacharias had a symbolical meaning, awaiting that
     offspring, which should be the forerunner of Christ ; that the light
     of the light of the truth, the word of the prophetic riddles, might
     become a gospel, or voice of good tidings, and so free itself of the
     mystical silence."

     (9.) But when we come to the times after our Lord's Ascension,
     it may appear that we no longer find the same frequency, the same
     unhesitating freedom, of mysitical exposition. Neither the Acts of
     the Apostles, nor the historical notices in the Epistles, are
     treated by them with the same constant allusion to mystical
     meanings, supposed to be undoubtedly contained in them. Instances of
     the kind are certainly not wanting ; as where St. Augustin on the
     conversion of St. Paul, reasons on the name Ananias, which he
     supposes to mean a sheep^171 ; and where Origen descants in the
     following way on St. Paul's recommendation of a collection for
     the poor saints in Jerusalem. He says^172 :

     "Every one who is spiritual, i. e. who serves God in the Spirit, and
     lives not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit, he
     dwells in Jerusalem, i. e. in the place of Peace, and abides in the
     Vision of Peace : and he is one of the poor saints, i. e. one of
     those blessed poor, to, whom our Lord said, ;Blessed are the
     poor in spirit.' . . . Being such he abides always in
     Jerusalem, possessing spiritual wealth. . . . On the other hand, it
     seems to me that those whom he calls Gentiles mean the less perfect
     souls, as standing, in need of, the instruction of the more perfect
     : and who, if so be they are accounted worthy to become partakers
     with them in spiritual understanding and knowledge, ought themselves
     to minister unto them in carnal things : and so, when their spirit
     begins to be imbued with something of loftier contemplation, the
     flesh also, taking on itself the reins of continence and of
     chastity, ought to minister to the spiritual precepts."

     And even Chrysostom, who in general is very jealous of producing
     allegorical meanings, has an intimation that he does not consider
     them as out of place in this part of Scripture history. For,
     speaking of the name Dorcas, as repeated in the verse, He
     remarks^173 :

     "They showed the garments which Dorcas had made for them. Not
     without significance is her name added in this place, but with a
     view of giving us to understand that she answered to her name,
     watchful and alert as the animal which it signifies, the antelope.
     For no less than a special providence goes to the assigning of many
     names, as I have often remarked to you."

     In spite, however, of scattered instances of this kind, it will
     perhaps hold, as a general observation, that mystical exposition is
     the exception, and not the rule, of the ancient commentators on the
     Acts and Epistles ; whereas through all former parts of the sacred
     history, it undoubtedly constituted the rule and not the exception.
     If this be really so, it is remarkable in several ways : and one
     thought which it obviously suggests is, that it proves the Mysticism
     of the ancients, right or wrong, not to have been practised at
     random, not to have been merely an unthinking accommodation to the
     taste of the age, the school, or the individual. In such case, it
     will be hard to assign a reason why it should not have been applied
     to the fortunes of Christ's people after His ascension, as
     largely as before His coming, or as to the events of His own life.
     Were the whole a matter of mere ingenuity, it will not surely be
     pretended, that the character and adventures of St. Paul, (for
     instance) might not be as dexterously turned into allegory, whether
     of the prophetic or moral kind, as those of David or St. John the
     Baptist. The abstinence of the ancient writers in this respect
     indicates their proceeding on some definite rule or principle,
     whether we can succeed in ascertaining the rule or no.

     (10.) The several heads of New testament Mysticism having thus been
     briefly noticed and exemplified, and appearing to be first, the
     affixing of spiritual import to the detail of parables, and to other
     imagery adopted by our Lord in His discourses ; secondly, the
     application of the like process to the circumstances of His history
     while on earth ; thirdly, to the names of persons and places any how
     connected to that history ; fourthly, and much more scantily, to the
     records of His Church after His departure ; we are in a condition to
     say something of the priciples on which the whole depended, and the
     authorities by which, when challenged, they were accustomed to
     vindicate it : and in the course of the discussion it will perhaps
     sufficiently appear, what weight is due to the difficulty mentioned
     in the outset, viz. That allegorizing the New Testament at all is
     inconsistent with the idea of its being, eminently, h a l h q e i a
     , the final dispensation---the substance and not the shadow.

     It may seem, then, that the mode of interpretation we are
     considering arose chiefly from the deep sense which those who used
     it entertained of two great truths,---fundamental truths---of
     the Gospel : the Divinity of our Lord, and the Communion of the
     Saints.

     (11.) First, did we really lay it to heart, as we read verse after
     verse of the Gospels---did we in earnest put our minds to the
     thought,---that this Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Mary, is
     indeed the Most High God, Creator and Possessor of Heaven and Earth,
     and of all things visible and invisible ; did we realize our
     conviction of this truth in connection with each and all of His
     actions and discourses, and of the scenes and circumstances in which
     we find Him engaged ; we should of course feel on all these
     subjects, that which considerate persons feel in regard of all
     God's words and works ; viz. That the least of them is far too
     deep for us ; the most trivial of His is exceeding broad ; the
     slightest, to our conception, of His acts must have eternal and
     infinite associations and consequences. The words then and doings of
     our Blessed Saviour, being as they are the words and doings of God,
     it cannot be but they must mean far more than meets the eye : they
     cannot but be full-charged with heavenly and mysterious meaning,
     whether we are as yet competent to discern some part of that meaning
     or no ; and to look at them in that light may be called Mysticism,
     but is it any more than the natural and necessary result of
     considerate faith in His divine nature ? Or can it be doubted, that
     so far as the Mysticism of the old interpreters is traceable to this
     conviction, so far it not only admits of justification, but the
     disuse of it is a fearful symptom of irreverent forgetfulness at
     least of that vital doctrine?

     On grounds like these, we may perhaps be excused in thinking,
     whatever we may judge of the particular examples, that the fathers
     could not be wrong in the general principle, which guided their
     comments in such instances as shall be now specified.

     (12.) Knowing our Lord to be the Governor and Overruler of all
     things, even the least, by His good providence, knowing from His own
     lips that not a sparrow falls to the ground without Him : they could
     not be wrong in noting those circumstances and accompaniments of His
     conduct, which in ordinary human language would be called
     accidental, as being in fact divinely ordered : worthy, from their
     nearness to Him, of being contemplated with particular awe, as
     forming part of the clouds and darkness that He gathers round about
     Him : which if we can at all penetrate by the help of other
     revelations, it is well ; if not, at least we may adore in silence.

     For example ; according to men's usual way of talking, it would
     be called an accidental circumstance, that there were five loaves,
     not more nor less, in the store of our Lord and His disciples,
     wherewith to provide the miraculous feast. But the ancient
     interpreters treat it as designed and providential, in this surely
     not erring : and their whole conjecture is, that it represents the
     sacrifice of the whole world of sense, and especially of the Old
     Dispensation, which being outward and visible, might be called the
     dispensation of the senses, to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
     to be a pledge and mean of communion with Him according to the terms
     of a new or evangelical law. This idea they arrive at by considering
     the number five, the number of the senses, as the Mystical exponent
     of the visible and sensible universe : t a a i s z h t a , as
     distinguished from t a n o h t a . Origen lays down the rule in
     express terms. "The number Five frequently, nay almost always, is
     taken for the five senses."

     Accordingly St. Clement^174, speaking of the Tabernacle door, which
     was hung on five pillars, says it was accounted by some a token of
     the separation between the intellectual and sensible worlds ; and he
     adds,

     "Thus, by a process full fraught with mysterious meaning, Five
     loaves are broken and multiplied by the Saviour, to the crowd of
     ordinary hearers ; for many one there be who regard the things of
     sense as if there were really nothing besides them."

     Origen more plainly^175 : "By the five loaves they perhaps might
     signify the outward and literal words of the Holy Scripture, literal
     and sensible, and therefore represented by the number of the five
     senses." Ambrose again^176, "It may seem that those five thousand,
     as though made up of the mere bodily senses which are five, received
     from Christ nourishment as yet little more than bodily." And
     Augustin^177 :

     "To pass over this subject rapidly ; the five loaves are understood
     to be the five books of Moses, with reason not represented as of
     wheat, but of barley, because they belong to the Old Testament. And
     barley, as you know, is so formed, that you come with difficulty to
     the nourishing part of it, wrapped up as it is in a covering of
     chaff, and that chaff stiff and cleaving, so as not to be stripped
     off without some trouble. Such is the letter of the Old Testament,
     clothed with the wrappings of carnal sacraments, or tokens ; but if
     you once come to its marrow, it nourishes and satisfies. If we ask,
     who was the lad that bare the loaves, perhaps it was the people of
     Israel ; with no more than childish thought, bearing them only, not
     tasting them."

     And elsewhere, expressing himself in such a way as to connect his
     view obviously to that of St. Clement^178.

     "The five barley loaves, wherewith the Lord fed the multitudes in
     the mountain, signify the old Law ; either because it is given to
     persons not yet spiritual, but still carnal i. e. devoted to the
     five bodily senses ; or because the Law was given by Moses, and the
     books written by Moses are five."

     It should still be recollected, that neither in this nor in other
     like instances is the tone of the Fathers at all dogmatical. They
     are positive only in one, point, that there is a spiritual meaning,
     could we but find it^179 ; but of their own special exposition they
     commonly speak as doubtfully as Origen on this very place whose
     language is^180 :

     "Thus far have I been able to reach in conjecturing the sense of the
     five loaves and the two fishes. But in all likelihood those who are
     better able to store themselves with [the spiritual food meant by]
     these symbols will be able to give a fuller account of these
     things."

     It may be added, perhaps, in support of the exposition which he thus
     modestly suggests, that it suits well with the nature of the
     miracle, considered as an intimation of the future Eucharistical
     sacrifice : in which light the subsequent discourse of our Lord
     undoubtedly teaches us to consider it. For the offering of bread and
     wine, to be received back again as the Lord's Body and Blood,
     is in effect, as far as in each of us lies, the sacrifice of all the
     things of sense, of our whole earthly being, to be made heavenly by
     participation of Jesus Christ.

     (13.) It is clear, again, referring to some examples given above
     that the names of the several places which our Lord chose wherein to
     utter His discourses and work His miracles, will come under the head
     which we are now considering---that of circumstances which in
     ordinary history might be called insignificant, but in this can
     hardly be less than providential. Our Lord's moving from place
     to place, among the towns, mountains, and rivers of Israel, was the
     moving of the God and King of Israel, among the places which He
     Himself had marked out, from all ages, to be the scene of His mighty
     words and works, when He should literally visit His people.

     So also, applying the same remark to His discourses, the imagery
     which He used, His references to natural objects, are to be looked
     at with other and far higher feelings than those of mere wonder and
     delight, such as the same words would cause, could we imagine them
     proceeding from human lips. Hiss mention (e. g.) of the birds of the
     air, the lilies, the vine and its branches, the wheat and tares, and
     whatever else occurs of the like kind, are so many instances of the
     Creator applying to moral or spiritual uses His own outward and
     visible works ; which works He had created, knowing in His
     Omniscience, that He should so apply them, and therefore (among
     their other final causes) with the, very purpose of doing so. And it
     is but carrying the same observation one step further, to say, that
     His not unfrequent allusions to domestic processes also, and the
     simpler modes of trade, and husbandry work, are in like manner
     allusions to things which Himself had prepared by His, providence,
     no doubt with a view to such application.

     The great use to be made of this will be seen by and by : at present
     it may serve to mitigate the disapproving wonder, with which some
     readers are apt to receive what may appear to them frigid and
     overstrained comments of the Fathers on the figurative language of
     our Lord, and the details of His parables.

     (14.) For example, St. Clement^181 applies the Parable of Leaven to
     illustrate the reserve which all know to have been one great feature
     of the teaching of the early Church. "By it," he says, "the Lord
     indicates the method of concealment." Then, quoting the parable, he
     subjoins :

     "Either it is the preservation of the soul which our Lord here
     describes,---of the soul, made up as it is of three parts,
     [memory, understanding, and will] and preserved in the way of
     obedience by the spiritual power hidden in it, according to the
     faith ; or else, [He speak's thus] the Power of the Word, given
     unto us, compressed in a scanty space, but of great might, attracts
     to Itself secretly and invisibly the whole of him who receives It
     and lays It up within himself, and gathers the whole complex being
     of that man by degrees into perfect unity."

     St. Augustin^182, and St. Ambrose^183, in effect give the same
     exposition ; all agreeing to annex a certain mystical force to the
     three measures ; to the woman ; whom take to be the Church, or
     Wisdom ; to the hiding of the leaven : and so in other parables ;
     those things which modern critics regard as the mere scenery or
     dress of the narrative, they fear to dispose of so easily,
     considering that He is speaking of them, who caused them to be what
     they are, with all their relations, similitudes, and association.

     (15.) But if the Fathers considered as providential and mystical the
     mere ornaments of our Lord's discourses, and the accompaniments
     of His proceedings on earth, much more would they regard in the same
     view the substance of His conduct, His own voluntary doings. It
     would never come into their mind to think they knew the whole
     meaning and bearings of it, any more than to imagine, as they looked
     upwards at night, that they saw through the whole depth of the sky,
     because, gazing more intently than others, more and more stars had
     become visible to them. They seem to have contemplated the whole
     subject with that feeling of infinity, which dictated St.
     John's concluding verse, "If the things which Jesus did should
     be written every one, I suppose that not even the world itself
     should be able to contain the books which should be written." Akin
     to which is the saying Origen^184 :

     "That the Gospel of St. John can hardly be understood but by one who
     should be like the writer of it, lying on the bosom of our Lord, and
     declared to be the Son of Mary, i. e. as it were another Jesus by
     communion with the true Jesus."

     According to the depth of significance here attributed to the least
     of our Lord's doings, we are to look at the minute details of
     His demeanour towards different persons, His modes of dealing with
     them for their good, as so many exemplifications,---so many
     visible types,---of His invisible dealings and dispensations
     towards the same class of persons always. If even "wise men and
     scribes," parents, say, or teachers or masters, very often use
     significant actions, expressing things far beyond any dream, that
     those who witness them can possibly have of their meaning ; shall it
     seem strange to be told, that we must regard all the actions of Him,
     who is infinite wisdom and goodness, as so many deep economies,
     answering, in all probability, purposes, of which we can no more
     judge, than a child in arms can judge of the meaning, of the holy
     services, which he may chance at any time to see performed in a
     Church.

     (16.) But to produce first a few instances, in which it seemed to
     the Fathers that we might in some measure interpret our Lord's
     significant actions :---Origen^185 has gone through great part of
     the discourse with the woman of Samaria, as a specimen of the way in
     which it pleases Him to deal with those who are not unbelievers but
     heretics : IrenÃ¦us expounds the washing the Disciples' feet to
     be a token of Christ communicating an interest in His Passion to all
     the Saints which had gone before, the whole Jewish and patriarchal
     Church. Thus he speaks^186 :

     "In the last times, when came the fulness of the time of liberty,
     the Word Himself by Himself cleansed away the filth of the daughter
     of Sion, washing with His own hands the feet of His Disciples. For
     this [in which we now are] is the end, [or last stage] of the human
     race entering on its inheritance, even God : that as in the
     beginning we were all brought into slavery by the debt of death
     [which we incurred], so in the end, by Him who is the Last, all who
     from the beginning had been Disciples, being cleansed and washed
     from the things of death, might enter into the life of GOD. For He
     who washed the feet of his Disciples, sanctified the whole body, and
     brought it into a state of pureness. Which is the reason also why He
     ministered food to them as they reclined, signifying those who were
     reclining in the earth, to whom He came to minister life."


     Origen, and after him Ambrose^187, assign a parabolical drift to the
     directions given by our Lord about preparing the Passover.

     "No one, keeping the Passover according to the will of Jesus, is
     below the upper room ; but whosoever feasts with Him, is on high, in
     a large upper room, in an upper room swept, in an upper room
     garnished and prepared : and if thou go up with Him to celebrate the
     Passover, He gives to thee no less a gift than the Bread of
     blessing, His own Body, and vouchsafes to thee His own Blood.
     Wherefore I beseech you, go up on high, lift up your eyes on high.
     And to me too, when I am engaged in teaching the Divine word, the
     Scripture says, ;Go up to high mountain, thou who tellest good
     tidings to Zion.'"

     And St. Ambrose^188 takes occasion from the command about the
     pitcher of water, to descant in honour of holy Baptism, carried
     away, as the Fathers use to be on that subject, perhaps above all
     others.

     (17.) It may be worth considering, whether the view in illustration
     of which these last examples have been offered, does not tend in
     some sort to explain and justify the practice which I have
     frequently mentioned, as not unusual with Origen and Clement, and
     with others who followed them, of adding to the prophetical or
     evangelical exposition of historical passages, what may be called a
     moral exposition also : of which an example has already been adduced
     from Origen, speaking of our Lord's entry into Jerusalem ; and
     the following may serve in further illustration of it^189.

     "The Lord in the Gospel affirms, concerning that woman who poured on
     His head the box of precious ointment, ;She hath wrought a good
     work on Me;' intimating that he who pours ointment on the Word
     of God, i, e. who joins actual obedience with that Word, that man
     worketh a good work. For the adorned with obedience and right
     actions is rendered, as it were, fragrant, filled with all sweetness
     of precious ointments."

     Here would seem at first sight a confusion between the two senses of
     "the Word," standing sometimes for the Scriptures, sometimes for the
     Person of our Lord. But the difficulty will perhaps vanish, on
     considering that the Word written or spoken was regarded by Origen
     as one only among many forms, in which the personal Word vouchsafes
     to communicate Himself to His servants. The things then which befel
     our Lord "visibly and personally" might well be taken as symbolical
     of the mode, in which His inward and invisible presence acts on, and
     is received by, the hearts of His servants ; as Origen himself gives
     us to understand, explaining the declaration of St. John the
     Baptist^190, "There standeth one among you whom ye know not," of
     "the presence of our Lord's most high Nature in all reasonable
     souls, reaching through the whole world." Comments, accordingly, in
     the Alexandrian and other Fathers, which at first sight, might
     appear like mere metaphysical disquisitions, about the supremacy and
     operations of reason, may be understood of Christ, and the
     operations of His grace; only recollecting that the ancients in
     their piety ascribed all sound reason to the Word, or Wisdom, of the
     Father, enlightening the soul.

     (18.) The Divinity then of our Lord, and His relation to mankind,
     would cause us to feel sure that all His words and doings must be so
     far mystical, as that they mean more, infinitely more, than meets
     the eye and ear of the mere human observer. But His Incarnation and
     Economy, of which His words and actions are part, may have had other
     objects, relative to other races and other states of being. Who
     knows but any given work or discourse of His may have reference to
     some of these, and we may have, consequently, to wait for its full
     explanation until (if ever) our eyes be opened to behold them in
     another world? Certainly there are obscure hints in Scripture, there
     is a partial, a very partial, disclosure, of some change in heaven
     as well as on earth, to be wrought by the Incarnation of the Son of
     God. "The principalities and powers in heavenly places," it is
     intimated, have some deep though undefined interest in that
     unspeakable Work of God, Which is our sanctification and salvation.
     Such hints unquestionably the New Testament contains : and it was
     the part of watchful piety, such as that of the Fathers, to notice
     and store them up : and what more natural, than that they should
     sometimes remember them, when engaged in the obscurer portions of
     the Gospel history, and should say within themselves, What if such
     and such a saying of our Lord, such and such a circumstance of His
     behaviour, evidently too profound for us, should belong to Him as
     the Lord of Angels rather than of men,---should allude to His
     government of heaven rather than of earth?

     By this train of thought, they would evidently open to themselves a
     new source of (what is called) Mysticism : the principle of which
     can hardly be denied, however unsoundly or presumptuously the
     details may have been managed. One or two examples shall be produced
     from Origen, the writer on mind these thoughts appear to have made
     most impression.

     He^191 applies the prophetic Saying of our Lord, "Other sheep I
     have, which are not of this fold," in who "look forward," he says,
     "with the rest of the Creation, to the revelation of the Sons of
     God, for whom they are commissioned to minister (being so far," as
     he expounds it, "made subject unto vanity') that they
     with the objects of their ministration may receive the inheritance
     of salvation, that of earthly and heavenly things there may be one
     fold and one shepherd." It may be remarked, by the way, that this
     comment on the place in the Romans, right or wrong, is not
     Origen's own. It occurs, as we have seen, in Clement's
     exposition of the parable of the good Samaritan. "^192Christ has
     commanded the authorities and powers to minister to us for a great
     reward, viz. that themselves may be delivered from the bondage of
     corruption." Again, Origen^193 considers the case of the fallen
     Angels to be very probably part of our Lord's meaning, in that
     very awful Proverb, "There are first which shall be last, and there
     are last which shall be first." And every where be is full of the
     presence of the elect Angels, and delights in contemplating our
     invisible communion with them ; not always perhaps judiciously, yet
     surely on the whole more wisely and scripturally, than they who
     banish the doctrine out of their thoughts, as though it were either
     a mere figure of speech, or an economy long laid aside, and to us
     mere matter of history.

     (19.) So much for that portion of the New Testament Mysticism, which
     seems to arise from the constant remembrance of the Omniscience of
     Jesus Christ, and His Supreme Dominion over things visible and
     invisible. Another large class of similar instances will be found,
     derived from another fundamental truth, viz. the Communion of
     Saints. By the Communion of Saints, is here meant the real, but
     mysterious and supernatural union of Jesus Christ with His Body the
     Church, and with every member of that Body : by virtue of which, the
     actions and sufferings of the Head may be predicated of the Body,
     and conversely those of the Body, of the Head : Israel may stand for
     Christ, and Christ for Israel : the one, e. g. where Moses is said
     to have "esteemed the reproach of Christ," i. e. of God's
     Church and people, which is in Christ's account one with Him,
     "more than the treasures of Egypt:" the other, where Hosea,
     combining in one expression the past and the future, says, "When
     Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called My Son out of
     Egypt."

     Again, David is a type of our Lord, and through Him of the Church
     which is His Body, and through that again of each individual
     Christian as being a member of that Body: and therefore the Psalms
     generally are adopted by the whole Church in her assemblies, and by
     separate believers in their closets, with equal propriety, as the
     language of their devotions : they are an inspired Liturgy, provided
     for all ages and all lands.

     As, therefore, the Divinity of our Lord even forces a considerate
     person to regard His demeanour towards those who, came near Him in
     the body, as indicative of His ways of grace and trial towards us,
     with whom He is invisibly present : so the unity between Him and His
     Church would lead us to inquire, from time to time, whether things
     which we find happening to Him may not be prophetic tokens of the
     future fortunes of the Church ; as well as His conduct a lesson to
     her, how to bear herself in her conflicts with the world.

     (20.) But here the nature of the case would enforce an important,
     distinction between the allegory of the Old Testament and that of
     the New; i. e. so far as both are prophetic. In the Old Testament
     the leading idea is, that the Church, whether diffusive, or embodied
     in her anointed members, king, priest, or prophet, is every where
     the type of Christ ; in the New, that Christ conversely is the type
     of the Church. "They, from Sheba shall come, they shall bring gold
     and incense :'---doubtless the immediate aspect of this
     prophecy is towards the wise men's offering at Bethlehem ; but
     that offering was itself prophetical of the kings of the earth
     coming in, and laying their glories at the feet of the Church, as
     the representative of Christ on earth. Again, "He shall bruise them
     with a rod of iron, and break them in pieces like a potter's
     vessel"---is transferred in the Acts from David to Christ, and in
     the Revelation from Christ to the Church. Our Lord being in this
     sense also both Alpha and Omega, the end of the ancient types and
     the beginning of a new series. In Him all that happened before was,
     as it were, brought to a point ; and all again that should come
     after, was but so many developments of what He said, did, and
     suffered among us.

     But it can scarce be necessary to dwell much on this part of the
     subject, since Christians in general appear to feel that each
     greater event of our Lord's abode on earth, His Passion, for
     example, in all its circumstances, was prophetic of the treatment
     which the Church, His Body, might expect, and at the same time
     symbolical of the inward process, whereby each one of His members
     should be trained and purified. The very expression, "taking up the
     Cross," seems to imply as much as this.

     But if so, surely there is something to be said for the introduction
     of the same idea in other passages also of our Saviour's life,
     and in explanation of other sayings of His. For example, there is a
     very ancient gloss on the saying, "Foxes have holes, and birds of
     the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay His
     head." "In this," says Clement of Alexandria^194, "I suppose there
     is an allusive meaning ; viz. that with him only who believes, and
     is perfectly separated from all those who in Scripture are described
     as wild beasts, does a resting place use to be found for the Head of
     all beings, the gracious and gentle Word ;" as if our Lord's
     literal want of a home, when He was here in the body, betokened the
     scarcity, which should ever be found on earth, of souls apt to
     receive and lodge Him worthily. Foxes would always find their dens,
     and birds of the air their nests : crafty and soaring thoughts would
     always find hearts enough ready to entertain them : not so the frank
     and open, the meek and lowly, Spirit of Christ.

     Such is St. Augustin's explanation^195 (amongst others) ; and
     it appears to be so far warranted, as that it is only an additional
     application of the same principle, which teaches us, with St.
     Cyprian^196, to consider Christ's coat without seam as a token
     of the unity of His Church, which her enemies, doing their worst,
     should be unable to rend : or with Clement^197, to look on His
     baptism as a token and type of ours. He affirms :

     "The Lord, is consecrated by the bath alone, and sanctified by the
     descent of the Holy Ghost. So it is ; and the same thing happens in
     us also, of whom the Lord is the type : by baptism we are
     enlightened, by enlightening we are adopted, by adoption we are
     consecrated [or perfected], by consecration [or perfecting] we are
     immortalized."

     St. Paul's language to the Romans and Colossians, implying
     Christ's death and resurrection to be, sacramentally and
     virtually, that of each baptized person, is too well known to be
     more than just alluded to. And there is imagery in the Revelations,
     in the vision of the Two Witnesses, which may justify us in
     surmising that the same awful events may in some sense find their
     counterpart in the history of the Church on earth.

     Whoever will consider and follow out these and similar hints, will
     see reason, perhaps, to excuse many things, which a hasty reader of
     the Fathers would call over-bold and fanciful : he will understand
     how Origen might affirm^198, that there are in fact as many
     different manifestations of the Word, as many different Christs, as
     there are believers : and again, that those who rest content with
     the mere outward meaning of the Gospel history, not recollecting as
     they go on, that in this same Jesus they live, and move, and have
     their spiritual being---that He is one with them, and they with
     Him---they are in the same kind of error as the Judaizers, who
     could not find Him in the Old Testament.

     (21.) So far then as the mystical interpretation of the Gospels
     depends on the Communion of Saints, it would appear to be amply
     authorized by the Scripture itself : neither need we be long to seek
     for similar authority in behalf of that branch of it, which has been
     already exemplified : that, namely, which results from the constant
     endeavour to realize, as we read, our Lord's high and
     transcendent Nature. As to His Parables, it is certain that in those
     which He has condescended to explain, in that of the Tares for
     example, every circumstance almost is made to tell ; so far from the
     attention being limited, as many modern interpreters would limit it,
     to the general result and moral only. Many of His actions are
     ascertained to be symbolical, in the way of Prophecy, or moral, or
     both : some by their correspondence with direct Parables ; as the
     cursing of the fig-tree, which agrees remarkably with the Parable of
     the barren fig-tree ; the multiplying the loaves and fishes,
     illustrated by the subsequent discourse on the Bread from Heaven ;
     and the miraculous draught of fishes, explained by the Parable of
     the net. Other actions, or circumstances of actions, have their
     figurative nature indicated by the use of some symbol, which
     God's providence has made appropriate, (o i k e i o n , as the
     rhetoricians call it,) to some particular subject ; as the change of
     water into wine, where the appropriation was made known afterwards
     by the institution of the Holy Eucharist. In other cases, as the
     choice of the ass and colt for the entry into Jerusalem, above
     considered, the terms of ancient Prophecy were a key to the mystery
     of the action. As to the miracles of our Lord's mercy, hearing,
     cleansing, enlightening, reviving,---there were sufficient hints
     given by Himself, in the conversations which followed upon some of
     them, how He would have them interpreted : as when He remarked on
     the case of the man who had been blind from his birth, "For judgment
     I am come into this world, that they which see not might see, and
     that they which see might be made blind :" and in the Parable of the
     relapsed dÃ¦moniac.

     (22.) The above considerations may perhaps put us in a condition to
     account in some measure for the comparative absence of Mysticism in
     the comments of Antiquity on the Acts and Epistles. Those, with
     whose words and actions those later Christian Scriptures are
     conversant, were actually in the Kingdom of Heaven : they were
     arrived at that final condition,---final as regards this
     world,---to which all former types and shadows had pointed, and
     in which, visibly or invisibly, they were now to be realized. They
     were not themselves, as far as we know, types and shadows of any
     thing further. Their condition indeed was full of mystery, of high,
     spiritual, invisible relations and associations : and so is our own
     condition, for theirs and ours are in substance one. But scantily
     and seldom, if at all, is any portion of the veil withdrawn, so as
     to justify the same kind of comment on the hidden bearings of the
     Apostles' history, or of that of any subsequent generation of
     believers, which God Himself had taught us to venture on, in all
     preceding Scriptures. With the exception of those sacramental
     actions, which being performed according to His command, are to be
     regarded as purely and indeed His actions, there are now no visible
     doings of Christ on earth : none, that is, visibly distinct from the
     doings of men ; none therefore to which we are warranted in
     specially affixing a mystical character, as being both the doings of
     God, and of Him who is one with the Church and with each of us.
     "Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every man that
     believeth :" that verse being once for all realized, the vision and
     prophecy is of course sealed up ; for there can be nothing beyond
     the end.

     (23.) On the whole, there seems no want of scriptural authority for
     the allegory as applied by the Fathers to the New Testament,
     considered both in what it includes, and in what it omits. Most
     modern interpreters even, and almost all devotional writers,
     recognise it in principle, some perhaps more or less unconsciously :
     but the great difference between them and the Ancients seems to lie
     rather in this; that the Ancients fear not to carry it out, in every
     part of the Gospels, and as far as it will go in every case; whereas
     we, in modern times, each draw his own arbitrary line, according to
     our own taste, or our notions of what is useful or convincing, or
     out of deference to the judgments we expect from others.

     And some perhaps may say, "After all, where is the great harm of
     this? the other may certainly be more legitimate and consistent in
     reasoning ; but practically, is it not safer, is it not even more
     religious and reverent, to abide by the letter, instead of
     perplexing yourself with expositions of which you cannot be quite
     sure ?" This, perhaps, is a thought not unlikely to be entertained
     by many minds. But let us be aware which way it leads :---to
     what, in reality, it amounts. Discarding high associations from our
     interpretations of Scripture, under the notion that a plain man may
     do well enough without them, appears rather like discarding high
     doctrines from our creed, as if they were only fit for professed
     theologians. It may be, that the one does not always lead to the
     other, but they may be symptomatic of the same unhealthy frame of
     thought : and is it not generally found, in fact, that the two more
     or less accompany each other, both in schools of divinity and in the
     fluctuation of individual minds ? Whitby's intense scorn of the
     ancient allegories was a step to the Arianism in which he finally
     acquiesced : and we know too well the region of doctrine towards
     which the merely critical and historical discussions of the last
     century were continually gravitating. Surely these are things worth
     the consideration of those, who shrink not only from promulgating,
     but even from fairly examining, the old principles of Biblical
     exposition, for fear of giving too much play, to the imagination, or
     some such kind of irreverence. Are they not unconsciously behaving
     like Ahaz, who, when God Himself offered him a sign, refused to ask,
     under the pretence or notion, that to do so would be tempting the
     Lord?

     (24.) It is most true, there is a great danger in the mystical
     contemplation of the Scriptures, more especially of the Gospels, by
     how much the Word of Life is there brought nearer to us, to be not
     only heard of, but also to be seen with our eyes, to be looked upon
     and handled with our bands. There is a great, an unspeakable danger,
     if our practice be not conformable. But this danger is not peculiar
     to the process of spiritual interpretation ; it belongs equally to
     all ways of communicating the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven ; to
     the Creeds and Prayers of the Church ; to the Catechisms which all
     children learn. And the remedy for it is not, in this or any other
     instance, to hide our eyes indolently from the light, which we know
     shines round us, but to strengthen them gradually, that they may be
     able to bear it ; and this can only be done by moral means ; i. e.
     by repentance, devotion, and self-denial. As we train ourselves, so
     also, according to our means, should we endeavour to prepare others
     for the right study of the Bible. He who looks no deeper than the
     letter, may simply recommend candour, and patient investigation, and
     freedom from sensual and other disturbing thoughts : but he who
     knows beforehand, that the Personal Word is every where in the
     written Word, could we but discern Him, will feel it an awful thing
     to open his Bible; fasting, and prayer, and scrupulous self-denial,
     and all the ways by which the flesh is tamed to the Spirit, will
     seem to him no more than natural, when he is to sanctify himself,
     and draw near, with Moses, to the darkness where God is. And this so
     much the more, the more that darkness is mingled with evangelical
     light; for so much the more be may hope to see of God ; and we know
     Who it is, that has inseparably connected seeing God with purity of
     heart.

     As therefore God's people are continually to be told,
     concerning the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist, that it is
     infinitely dangerous to come near it unworthily, but they are not
     therefore to leave it out of their minds, but rather to think of it
     night and day, that they may prepare themselves, and come as God
     would have them : so is it with this mystical presence of Jesus
     Christ in every part of the Scriptures. We are not to shrink from
     the thought of it for fear of irreverence, but hearing it
     continually in mind, we are to train ourselves so, that we may have
     grace to discern it, according to our measure, in particulars. This
     training is no matter of intellectual acuteness, industry, and
     memory : they will only mislead into some wrong kind of Mysticism,
     if separated from a single mind, and a heart full of reverence : but
     he that is willing indeed to do His will, he shall know p e r i t h
     z d i d a c h z , "concerning the manner of teaching," as well as
     the substance, "whether it be of God." Common sense surely will add,
     that one necessary sign of this willing reverence of heart, will be
     our religiously walking by the clue, which the ancient Church has
     given us, wherever we can keep satisfactory hold of it ; never
     daring to contradict the unanimous voice of the Fathers, still less
     to treat with scorn and mockery the serious opinion, though it be
     but of one among them.

     (25.) On the other hand, no ignorance, not even inability to read,
     disqualifies men from thus receiving our Lord in His Scriptures. It
     does not hinder them from seeing God's hand in His natural
     Providence, in His care of their own and others' welfare : why
     should it make them incapable of perceiving His supernatural
     Providence, (if one may so call it)---the presence of His
     Christ,---in all those works of His, the record of which they
     hear from time to time in Church, or at home out of their Bibles ?
     Such perception of our Lord's presence, through the veil of the
     letter, is in fact the religious improvement of the fondness for
     type and parable, natural to all, but often most developed in those
     who have least means of acquiring literal instruction. From which it
     would seem, that we need not fear to inure even poor unlearned
     persons, having the fear of God, and leading good lives, with the
     ancient mode of exposition. Humanly speaking, their habits of
     thought make them for the most part apter to receive it, than
     persons of greater learning and refinement.

     But whether to wise or simple, to learned or unlearned, the great
     and certain advantage of this method, (over and above its positive
     truth) is this : that it tends so directly in every part and parcel
     of the Scriptures, to keep up the conviction that God in Christ is
     there, ready to reveal Himself to us with a blessing, if we seek Him
     religiously and worthily. This conviction, continually realized and
     acted on, will prove to be of unspeakable value, though we never
     were conscious of a single discovery, a single new interpretation,
     in the ordinary sense of that term. Such faithful self denying
     labour will be worth a double "hidden treasure" to us, bringing us
     secretly into closer Communion with Him, in whom are now hidden, one
     day to be revealed, "all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."

     These remarks may suffice, on the manner of the Fathers as Mystical
     Interpreters of the Bible. We shall next have to consider them as
     Mystical Observers of natural and providential things, and of the
     visible world around us : a kindred subject, as a little inquiry
     will show.

     Â§ vi.-Mysticism as applied to the Works of Nature, and generally to
                             the external World.

     Whatever judgment persons may be inclined to form of the early
     Christian interpretations in themselves, it is clear and certain
     matter of fact, and surely well worthy of remark, that on all the
     great divisions of human knowledge the Fathers had, as a school,
     views of their own. Whether it was history of which they were
     speaking, or the arts of life, or morals public or private, their
     measures of things, and the tone they preserved, were widely
     different from all that had gone before them : hardly more so,
     however, (it is a startling but true confession,) than they differ
     from the principles and manner adopted in other ages, especially
     perhaps in our own, by Christian writers on the same subjects.

     But of all branches of human knowledge there is none in which this
     difference is more strongly marked, than in what relates to the
     study of nature, and the laws and aspects of the external world. We
     know how very large a part of modern literature and education, nay,
     and of modern theology too, is occupied by instruction and research
     on physical subjects, and in what a tone of self-complacency men
     praise their times and one another, for the great and rapidly
     increasing proficiency of the two or three last generations in their
     knowledge and command of the powers of nature. But when we turn to
     the first ages of Christian literature, the very first sentiment
     which strikes us is, the care taken every where to exclude views
     merely scientific and physical,---to prevent our acquiescing in
     that kind of knowledge, as though in itself it were any great thing.
     Hear, e. g. the tone in which St. Augustin explains what attention
     is due from that, which of all physical sciences we are taught
     sometimes to account the most elevating,---to astronomy.

     "The knowledge," he says^199, "of the rising and setting, and other
     motions of the stars, though it bind men by no superstition, yet is
     of little or rather no avail for the explanation of Holy Scripture,
     but is rather an impediment, by diverting attention unprofitably :
     and inasmuch as it is closely connected with the most deadly error
     of the chanters of silly predictions, it is better and more
     creditable to let it pass." Some might perhaps imagine that in this
     passage St. Augustin was ignorantly confounding astronomical with
     astrological science. But the next sentences contradict the
     suspicion. "It is true," he adds, "that besides the observation of
     existing phenomena, astronomical science contains in it something,
     of the nature of history, inasmuch as from the present positions and
     motions of the heavenly bodies we may, according to certain rules,
     retrace their movements in times past. Again, it hath certain rules
     for judging of things future ; not in the way of mere conjecture and
     omen, but fixed and settled rules ; not such as to authorize our
     concluding aught from them concerning our own conduct and fortunes,
     which is the madness of those who calculate nativities---but
     facts appertaining to the heavenly bodies themselves. For as the
     computers of the lunar motions, observing how old the moon is today,
     are able to assign its age at any distance of years forward and
     backward, so concerning any heavenly body whatever, scientific
     reckoners are wont to give determinate answers."

     It was not then from inadequate conceptions of the true province and
     evidence of astronomy, that St. Augustin assigned to it so low a
     place in the pursuits of a Christian student ; but it was clearly
     from a perception that such knowledge was but very remotely
     connected with the proper duty and happiness of mankind. And St.
     Augustin was no unlearned man, nor at all apt to set himself
     fanatically against the use of human knowledge in the interpretation
     of Divine Truth.

     (2.) But in truth he was here only expressing the constant sentiment
     of the Church, such as we find it laid down in the first and second
     ages, almost in the form and with the authority of an apostolical
     canon. Says IrenÃ¦us^200:

     "It is better to know nothing at all, no, not so much as one single
     cause of any of the things which are made, but to believe in God,
     and to persevere in love, than to be puffed up with that sort of
     knowledge, and fall from love, which gives life to man. It is better
     to seek nothing in the way of knowledge but Jesus Christ the Son of
     God, who was crucified for us, than to fall into impiety through
     subtle questions and minute verbal discussions. Suppose, e. g. that
     any one, more or less elated with efforts of this kind, should take
     occasion from our Lord's saying, ;The very hairs of your
     head are all numbered,' to make curious inquiry, and search out
     both the number of hairs in each person's head, and the cause
     why one has so many, and another so many . . . . and so persons
     fancying they had discovered the right number, should endeavour to
     give it a meaning in reference to the teaching which they had
     devised for their own sect : or again, suppose that any one, upon
     the saying in the Gospel, ;Are not two sparrows sold for a
     farthing, and not one of them can fall to the earth without the will
     of your Father,' should take upon him to enumerate the sparrows
     which are daily taken in this place and that, and in all places, and
     make out the reason why so many were caught yesterday, so many the
     day before, and again so many today and connect the said number of
     sparrows with his own argument : doth not such an one altogether
     deceive himself, and are not those who agree with him forced along
     with him into great impiety ? Men being always forward in such
     speculations, that they may obtain the credit of having made out
     each something more than his master.

     "Again, suppose a man should ask us, ;Doth not God know the
     whole number of all things which have been and are being made? Did
     not each of these numbers receive by His providence the amount which
     was suitable to it ?' we of course should assent, nothing ever
     did or doth come into being without the knowledge of God ; that by
     His providence is assigned to each of them its proper kind, place,
     number and quantity ; that nothing at all ever was or is made vainly
     or at random, but with great fitness and a lofty kind of harmony.
     Whereupon it would follow, that there was something admirable and
     truly divine in that method, which should be able both to discover
     and express the said numbers with their proper causes. Suppose him
     then on receiving from us such allowance and consent, to proceed to
     enumeration of the sand and pebbles of the earth, yea, also of the
     waves of the sea, and the stars of heaven, and to invent causes for
     the number which be fancied himself to have found ; would not his
     labour be justly judged vain by all considerate persons, and he
     himself bereft of all sense and reason ? And by how much he employs
     himself more than others in inquiries of that kind, and the higher
     opinion he has of his own peculiar inventions, calling others
     ignorant, and ordinary, and carnal ; so much the rather is be to be
     judged senseless and stupid, like a planet-struck person, making
     himself equal with God. Yea, by the knowledge which be fancies
     himself to have attained, be surpasses God Himself, and aims his
     speculations higher than the very greatness of His Maker."

     It is plain that the author of this impressive warning did not only
     fear the fanciful application of natural science to the things of
     God, but also the tendency which it has in itself to make men
     overweening and irreligious. It is plain also that he did not
     consider this evil tendency sufficiently disproved by that constant
     reference to the final causes of things, on which many now seem apt
     to rely, as taking out the sting of physical studies entirely. His
     painful intercourse with heresy had taught him, that the fancy of
     possessing rare insight into the purposes of the Author of Nature is
     almost as great a snare, as the habit of contemplating nature
     without reference to any Author. The very attempt to know
     all---the very dreaming of such a thing---he felt was impiety
     ; a deep sense of our necessary ignorance, and an humble
     acquiescence in it, the only safeguard of the inquisitive ingenious
     mind.

     (3.) Accordingly, those ancient writers, who have dwelt most on the
     wisdom of God in the creation---such as St. Basil, in his
     HexaÃ«meron, and St. Ambrose, his imitator, one might almost say,
     his translator---have not thought it enough for piety, to urge
     every where the final causes of things, as disclosed by natural
     philosophy and history, but have also, again and again, admonished
     their readers, that no laws of nature will account for every thing,
     that the wisest must soon come to a point, where he must stand
     still, and say, "Thus far I seem to trace things, but I can go no
     farther ; I can but make acknowledgment with those Egyptian
     philosophers, ;This is the finger of God.'"

     Thus St. Ambrose, being about to enter on the detail of Creation in
     the second day's work, prefaces his remarks with a solemn
     caution^201,

     "not to weigh what should be said by the traditions of philosophy,
     and its empty deceit, nor to gather up persuasive probabilities ;
     but to choose for their standard the rule of truth as expressed in
     the oracles of the Divine word, and poured into the bosom of the
     faithful by the contemplation of so high majesty : since it is
     written, ;Establish me in Thy words. The ungodly have
     propounded unto me discourses---d i h g s a n t o a d o l e s c i
     a z ---but not after Thy law. All Thy commandments are
     truth.'

     "It is not, therefore, by the nature of the elements, but by the
     nature of Christ, who hath done all according to His will, abounding
     in the fulness of His Godhead, that we are to order our thoughts of
     what was made, and our inquiries into that which nature could bring
     about. Even as in the Gospel, when He was curing the leprous, and
     pouring light anew on the eyes of the blind, the people present and
     beholding His works acknowledged not any course of medical cure,
     but, in admiration of the Lord's power, gave, as it is written,
     glory to God. Nor was it on calculation of the numbers of the
     Egyptians, the combinations of the heavenly bodies, the proportions
     of the elements, that Moses stretched forth his hand to the division
     of the Red Sea, but in simple obedience to the commandment of
     God's power. Whence also he saith himself, ;Thy right
     hand, O Lord, hath waxed glorious in power; Thy right hand, O Lord,
     hath dashed in pieces the enemy.'"

     Concludes St. Ambrose :

     "That way, therefore,that way do ye lift up your minds, ye who form
     this holy congregation ; and turn your whole spirit in that
     direction. God seeth not as man seeth : GOD looketh on the heart,
     man on the outward appearance. By the same rule, neither doth man
     see as GOD doth. Thou hearest, that God saw, and approved : far be
     it then from thee to judge by thine eyes of the things which He
     made, or by thine own thoughts to argue concerning them ; rather,
     what God saw, and approved, see that thou account not those things
     matter of free discussion."

     This by way of general caution. Afterwards, in a question about the
     conflux of the waters on the third day, he gives a specimen of the
     mode in which ancient piety would silence physical objections. He
     supposes a mere physiologist objecting to the literal truth of the
     Mosaical statement, that, according to the nature of water, it must
     have found its level before ; it could not need the special divine
     command. St. Ambrose's answer is, virtually^202 :

     "How do you know, that before God gave the command it was the nature
     of the waters so to glide or flow ? For this is a quality which they
     have of their own, not after the manner of the other elements, but
     special and peculiar ; not by any certain order of causes, but by
     the direct will rather, and operation of the Most High God. What He
     commanded, they hear. Now the Voice of God is that which gives being
     to nature. The actual operation of things was, and is, but the
     fulfilment of that Word. Presently water begins to flow, and to pour
     itself into one assemblage, having hitherto been diffused over the
     earth, and keeping its place in many different receptacles. I read
     nothing of its course before ; of its motion, before, I learn
     nothing; mine eye hath not seen, nor mine ear heard. The water was
     stationary in divers places ; at the Voice of God it was put in
     motion. Doth it not appear that its nature was communicated to it by
     the aforesaid Voice of God ? His creature followed His commandment,
     and turned His law into an usage. Thus the law of His first
     establishment of things bequeathed them a form to all future time.
     To conclude : He made day and night once for all : from that moment
     continues the alternation and renewal of each of them, throughout so
     long a time. Even so was the water commanded to run into one
     assemblage, and from thenceforth it does so run"

     This principle obviously applies no less to all the great simple
     facts in nature : it is the principle of natural piety, "things are
     such, because God made and keeps them such :" the most skilful
     analyst, the most dextrous combiner of machinery, must come to this
     at last : and if he would but be content to refer to it, and realize
     his dependence on it, throughout, he would go far towards securing
     himself from the peculiar dangers of his line of study^203.

     (4.) But the one great and effectual safeguard against such
     idolizing of the material world, or rather of our own minds acting
     upon it, is the habit of considering it in that other point of view,
     to which Christian Antiquity would guide us, as earnestly as it
     would withdraw us from the speculations of the mere natural
     philosopher. I mean the way of regarding external things, either as
     fraught with imaginative associations, or as parabolical lessons of
     conduct, or as a symbolical language in which God speaks to us of a
     world out of sight : which three might, perhaps, be not quite
     inaptly entitled, the Poetical, the Moral, and the Mystical, phases
     or aspects of this visible world.

     Of these, the Poetical comes first in order, as the natural
     groundwork or rudiment of the other two. This is indicated by all
     languages, and by the conversation of uneducated persons in all
     countries. There is every where a tendency to make the things we see
     represent the things we do not see, to invent or remark mutual
     associations between them, to call the one sort by the names of the
     other.

     The second, the Moral use of the material world, is the improvement
     of the poetical or imaginative use of it, for the good of human life
     and conduct, by considerate persons, according to the best of their
     own judgment, antecedent to, or apart from, all revealed information
     on the subject.

     In like manner, the Mystical, or Christian, or Theological use of it
     is the reducing it to a particular set of symbols and associations,
     which we have reason to believe has, more or less, the authority of
     the Great Creator Himself.

     Now the first peculiarity of the Fathers' teaching on this head
     having been shown to be their jealousy of the merely scientific use
     of the external world, the next appears to be their instinctively
     substituting the mystical use in its room; not a merely poetical or
     a merely moral, but a mystical, use of things visible; according to
     the exposition of the word mystical just above given.

     (5.) To state the matter somewhat differently : If we suppose Poetry
     in general to mean the expression of an overflowing mind, relieving
     itself, more or less indirectly and reservedly, of the thoughts and
     passions which most oppress it :---on which hypothesis each
     person will have a Poetry of his own, a set of associations
     appropriate to himself for the works of nature and other visible
     objects, in themselves common to him with others:---if this be
     so, what follows will not perhaps be thought altogether an
     unwarrantable conjecture ; proposed, as it ought, and is wished to
     be, with all fear and religious reverence. May it not, then, be so,
     that our Blessed Lord, in union and communion with all His members,
     is represented to us as constituting, in a certain sense, one great
     and manifold Person, into which, by degrees, all souls of men, who
     do not cast themselves away, are to be absorbed ? and as it is a
     scriptural and ecclesiastical way of speaking, to say, Christ
     suffers in our flesh, is put to shame in our sins our members are
     part of Him ; so may it not be affirmed that He condescends in like
     manner to have a Poetry of His own, a set of holy and divine
     associations and meanings, wherewith it is His will to invest all
     material things ? And the authentic records of His will, in this, as
     in all other truths supernatural, are, of course, Holy Scripture,
     and the consent of ecclesiastical writers.

     (6.) It may be as well here to anticipate an objection, not unlikely
     to occur on first meeting with the above statement. How, it may be
     asked, are we to know, whether any particular image in an ancient
     Christian writer be properly mystical, or merely moral or poetical ?
     the momentary flight of some pious fancy, the edifying analogy
     observed by some impressive teacher, or a true token from the
     Creator of all things, given to our senses, of some truth which He
     would fix in our hearts ? Any given image, on the face of it, may be
     either of these three : how are we to distinguish, with any
     certainty, the one from the other ?

     Now, in the first place, the objection proceeds on the unhappy and
     untenable supposition, that the truth, if we can at all approach it,
     must be clear and plain to us throughout, and leave nothing
     unaccounted for. Surely there may be in the remains of Antiquity a
     human and a Divine Mysticism, without our being always, or even
     generally, able to draw the exact line between the two. We ourselves
     may be unworthy to decypher the writing, or our age may have lost
     the key to it, and yet we may be sure that it is, in part at least,
     a communication from the Source of Truth : and the fact may be most
     desirable for us to know, were it only that we might learn reverence
     in our way of dealing with the subject.

     Is there not something analogous in the case of Holy Scripture
     itself ? We have reason to think that the personal character and
     circumstances of the several inspired writers was permitted to
     influence them, more or less, in their style and mode of
     composition. But where, and how far, we can have no exact knowledge.
     It is seldom, if ever, given us to determine, what images were
     suggested to any Prophet or Apostle by his own ordinary experience,
     and what were immediately prompted by the Holy Ghost.

     If this does not hinder our using the Scriptures to edification, no
     more need the other prevent our profiting by the imagery of the
     Fathers, in our mode of considering the visible and external world.

     (7.) In effect, however, universal consent will carry us further in
     this matter, as in many others, than we should be apt beforehand to
     imagine. There is a wonderful agreement among the Fathers, in the
     symbolical meanings, which they assign to most of the great objects
     in nature ; such an agreement as completely negatives the
     supposition of the whole having sprung from mere poetical
     association. It were against all calculation of probabilities, that
     so many writers, of various times, nations, and tempers, and in such
     different lines of life, should either light on the same set of
     figures independently of one another, or coincide in imitating any
     one who had gone before them with no special authority; more
     especially, as many of the symbols are far from possessing, at first
     sight, that exquisite poetical fitness, which would be required,
     regarding the whole as a matter of taste ; on the contrary, not a
     few of them are blamed, by the disparagers of Antiquity, on this
     very account, that they are so forced, overstrained, and irrelevant,
     and what classical judges might perhaps call y u c r a .

     Thus they complain, not perceiving that the fact on which they rest,
     if it were granted, tends on the whole to make us suppose a higher
     origin for the imagery in question, than any man's poetical or
     imaginative taste. Such writers, for example, as St. Ambrose or St.
     Cyprian, St. Chrysostom, or St. Gregory Nazianzen, who evince in
     their remains the most vivid sense of poetical delicacy and beauty
     ;---when we find them all concurring in the use of symbols, such
     as have now been described, must we not suppose that they drew from
     a common source, and were guided in their selection by something
     deeper than imaginative delight in the, beauties of nature, and in
     the exercise of their own ingenuity.

     (8.) The same may be said of the hypothesis (if such should occur to
     any one) which would make these allusions of the old writers merely
     moral ; i. e. so many analogies or similitudes selected by
     themselves, from the course of human life or external nature, to
     render some truth or precept more forcible and vivid. I do not deny
     that such analogies occur ; especially when they are employed, as by
     St. Basil and St. Ambrose, in their HexaÃ«meron before mentioned, in
     descanting on the works of Creation. For example, we may take St.
     Basil's account of a mode which the gardeners bad of correcting
     the insipid wateriness of certain fruits^204.

     "Some plant the wild figs close to the cultivated : others bind the
     fruit of the forest fig to the mild and cultivated sort, and so heal
     its insipidity, the juice of the wilder having the effect of keeping
     the other from melting and falling away. Would you know what this
     riddle, presented to you by nature, signifies ? That we should often
     do well to resort even to those who are aliens from the faith, and
     from them assume a kind of steady vigour, for the performance of
     good works. I mean, should you see any one either living as a
     heathen, or separated from the Church by perverse heresy, yet
     behaving soberly and observing discipline generally in his moral
     conduct, do thou draw more strictly the bands of thine own goodness,
     and so become like the fruitful fig tree, gathering energy to itself
     from the presence of its wild kindred, so as both to stay its fruit
     from failing, and cherish it more effectually to its full size."

     It is easy to see that St. Basil produces this particular parable as
     an invention of his own, claiming no particular authority for it.
     And this I call the moral way of symbolizing natural objects.

     At the same time, it may appear from the phrase t i s o i t o p a r
     a t h z s u k h z a i n i g m a b o i l e t a i ; that he was
     speaking as one himself aware, and among persons who made no
     question, that every part of nature has its appropriate a i n i g m
     a , if we could but find it out. Now this was an opinion which St.
     Basil was little likely to frame for himself, through excessive
     indulgence to his own fancy, since be of all, the Fathers most
     earnestly protests against the unrestrained use of allegory. We must
     then conclude that the sacramental or symbolical view of nature
     which he implies in the last-mentioned clause, had been received by
     him as an acknowledged, truth, not struck out as a speculation of
     his own.

     In other places indeed he avows it more distinctly : e. g. where he
     speaks of the heavenly bodies^205:

     "If the heaven is, vast beyond the measure of human understanding,
     what mind then shall have power to trace out the nature of the
     invisible things ? If the sun, which is subject to decay, is so
     fair, so, large, so swiftly moving, yet so regular in fulfilling its
     courses,---being both for magnitude proportioned to the universe,
     so as not to exceed the due relation to the whole system, and for
     beauty a sort of clear eye to nature, the very ornament of all
     creation,---if I say this be a sight of which one can never have
     too much, what must He be for beauty, who is the Sun of
     Righteousness! If the blind have a loss in not beholding this our
     sun, how great is the sinner's loss in being deprived of the
     True Light."

     Of this epithet, True, thus applied, more will be said by and by; I
     will but suggest here, that on consideration it may possibly be
     found to involve the whole theory here contended for.

     In the next paragraph, St. Basil speaks thus of the heavenly bodies
     in general :

     "As the fire is one thing and the lamp another, the one properly
     having power to enlighten, the other made to conduct the light
     according to our needs ; so were the lights of heaven now framed as
     a vehicle for that purest and unmingled and immaterial light. Even
     as the Apostle calls certain,

     ;Lights in the world,' although the True Light of the
     world is other than they ;---such as that by participation of It
     the Saints became lights of the souls whom they disciplined,
     delivering them from the gloom of ignorance:---so also in the
     creation was this visible sun, stored with that brightest light, by
     the maker of all, and kindled in the world."

     These, and similar divine parables, so to call them, are evidently
     introduced in somewhat of a different tone from that before quoted
     about the cultivation of figs, which was introduced expressly and
     formally as a new thing ; whereas these assume a certain
     familiarity, on the hearer's part, with the symbolical imagery.

     (9.) If one were to call these latter, of the sun and stars,
     examples of a symbolical or sacramental view of nature, it would
     perhaps be no improper mode of expressing the fact here intended ;
     viz. that the works of God in creation and providence, besides their
     immediate uses in this life, appeared to the old writers as so many
     intended tokens from the Almighty, to assure us of some spiritual
     fact or other, which it concerns us in some way to know. So far,
     therefore, they fulfilled half at least of the nature of sacraments,
     according to the strict definition of our Catechism : they were
     pledges to assure us of some spiritual thing, if they were not means
     to convey it to us. They were, in a very sufficient sense, Verba
     visibilia.

     (10.) This relation of things sensible to spiritual, appears to be
     indicated by St. IrenÃ¦us, who is the rather to be quoted on such a
     subject, because he seems to be unsuspected of Platonism, or any
     like forms of opinion, such as are supposed to have biassed the
     Alexandrian school. He states as follows the analogy between
     God's visible dealings with us, and His invisible
     dispensations^206.

     "The Word was made the dispenser of the Father's grace for the
     profit of men, on account of whom He made so many arrangements; on
     the one hand shewing God to man, on the other presenting man to GOD
     ; on the one hand maintaining the invisibility of the Father, lest
     at any time man should, become a contemner of God, and that he might
     always have something to reach after and advance towards ; on the
     other hand, manifesting God to the sight of men by many
     arrangements, lest man, falling altogether away from God, should
     cease to be. For, the glory of God is a living man, but the life of
     man is the vision of God. And if that manifestation of God which is
     by the creature, supplies life to all things living upon the earth,
     much more that manifestation of the Father, which is by the Word,
     supplies life to those who have the sight of God."

     This sentiment seems to warrant us in extending to the whole
     creation the maxim which occurs repeatedly in IrenÃ¦us, as
     concerning the Old Testament. "Nihil enim otiosum, neque vacuum
     signo, apud Deum." The occasions, indeed, on which this saying is
     introduced, belong either to the types of the Law, or the history of
     the Patriarchs. But the saying itself has a proverbial air which
     gives it a much wider reference. It may seem to answer to that deep
     sentiment, which appears to run through the philosophical works of
     St. Augustin, and which he has himself expounded in the Book de
     Libero Arbitrio, II. 41^207.

     As the whole life of the body is the soul, so the happy life of the
     soul is God. . . And in so much as, it is granted us to rejoice in
     those true and certain goods, gleaming upon us even while yet in
     this dark journey, consider whether this, be not what is written
     concerning wisdom ; ;she will shew herself to them cheerfully
     in the way, and meet, them with every kind of Providence :' i.
     e. which ever way thou turnest thyself, she speaks to thee by
     certain traces which she hath impressed upon her works, and when
     thou slippest back to external things, recalls thee by the very
     forms of those external things. So that whatsoever delights thee in
     the body, and allures thee by the bodily senses, thou mayest
     perceive to be according to certain numbers ; and inquiring its
     origin, mayest return into thyself, and understand that whatever
     reaches thee by the bodily senses, cannot be to thee an object of
     approbation or the contrary, except thou hast within thee certain
     laws of beauty, to which thou mayest refer whatever seems outwardly
     fair to thee."

     Then, having given instances in the works of nature and of art, in
     the beauty of motion and of form, and in the science itself of
     numbers, gradually tracing all to their mysterious origin, God
     revealing Himself by His Word or Wisdom, he breaks out into the
     following beautiful admonition^208 :

     "Woe to those who forsake Thee their guide, and go astray in Thy
     footsteps; who love Thy beckonings instead of Thee, and forget what
     Thou intimatest by them, O Wisdom, most delectable light of the
     purified spirit. For never dost Thou cease to beckon to us, what and
     how great Thou art, and all beauty in Thy creatures is but so many
     beckonings of Thine."

     Elsewhere, in a vein of stricter argument, he shews how each created
     thing, in that it is created, is an image or symbol of the Most Holy
     Trinity^209.

     All these things then, made as they are by Divine skill, exhibit in
     themselves both a certain unity, and a certain kind, and a certain
     order. For whatever of these things exists, is first some one thing,
     such as are the frames of bodies, and the intellectual powers of
     souls : next, it is formed according to a certain kind, such as are
     the figures and qualities of bodies, and the faculties of knowledge
     or of art, which distinguish souls : lastly, it craves or retains a
     certain order, to which head belong the weights and positions of
     bodies, the appetites and delights of souls. It behoves us
     therefore, looking at the Creator, Who is understood by the things
     that are made, to form the idea of a Trinity, whereof in each
     creature, according as it is meet, is to be seen some trace."

     (11.) But it is not so much the manner of the Fathers to express
     their principles of interpretation in set statements, as to be
     continually referring to them, exemplifying them, and variously
     bringing them out. Now there is no need, of course, to prove the
     abundance of mystical allusion in the early Christian writers. It is
     the very point which has most exposed them to the censure of modern
     schools. But it may be of use to produce some specimens of it,
     which, if they be fairly selected, and insufficiently explained by
     the general statement above, may so far afford a presumption in its
     favour. Perhaps it will be as fair an experiment as any, if we take
     the two treatises which have been already cited, the HexaÃ«meron of
     St. Basil, and that of St. Ambrose : if indeed they can properly be
     denominated two treatises, the one being in many parts but a free
     translation of the other.

     Their peculiar fitness for such a purpose, lies partly in their
     subject, and partly in the character of their authors. The subject,
     the history of creation, was one which put them especially on their
     guard against excess of symbolizing, to the disparagement of the
     historical sense ; as is proved by St. Basil's earnest and
     repeated protest, cited before in these papers. His habits of
     thought were moreover of that severe and scrupulous cast, which
     would least suffer the imagination to take liberties.

     The tendency of St. Ambrose, it may be thought, was rather the
     reverse of St. Basil's in this respect. But he too has several
     observations, implying that be dared not indulge his own or his
     hearers' fancy for mystical expositions, beyond a certain
     extent. Comparing the literal meaning to simple fare, which it is
     both charity and good sense to offer, rather than send the guests
     away hungry ; ha says^210 :

     "Elisha did not blush to set before them barley loaves : and are we
     ashamed, when we find things thus designated by their simple and
     proper names, to understand by them simply the things created ? We
     read of Heaven, let us take it to be Heaven : we read of earth, let
     us understand that earth which bears fruit."

     Ambrose then apologised for abiding so much by the letter : Basil
     strongly reproved those who were for wandering from it too widely.
     Concerning each therefore, it is evident, that when they, did allow
     themselves to allegorize, they were proceeding on some principle,
     not merely pleasing themselves. The one probably would have had more
     of this sort, the other less, had it not been for the Church's
     recognised line of interpretation. As it is, they furnish between
     them a list of symbols, which ranges through no small portion of
     created nature.

     (12.) First, we have the sum of this visible world declared to be an
     index or token of the invisible. Observes St. Ambrose^211,

     "Some understand the word, ;beginning,' in the first verse
     of Genesis, not in reference to time, but before time : as meaning
     the chief point, or head, as if one should say in Latin, summa
     operis ; heaven and earth being the sum of all visible things. And
     visible things seem to bear relation, not only to the fitting up of
     this world, but also to the setting forth of things invisible, and
     to furnish a sort of argument of the things which are not seen ;
     according to the saying in the Prophet, ;The Heavens declare
     the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth His handywork.'
     After whom the Apostle, in other words, but in the same sentiment,
     winds up his discourse, saying, ;That the invisible things of
     Him are understood by the things which are made.' For we
     readily think of Him as the Author of angels, and dominations, and
     powers, by the moving power of whose Word this world, so beautiful,
     was caused to be out of nothing, not having before existed."

     (13.) As to particulars : the arch of the sky^212 is a canopy spread
     over the tents and dwellings of the saints. This, in reference to
     its form : and then, in reference to the material of which the
     canopy of the tabernacle in the desert was made, the sky again is a
     scroll, whereon are written "the names of those many, who have
     attained Christ's favour by their faith and devotion ; to whom
     it is said, ;Rejoice, because your names are written in
     heaven.'"

     The flight and hovering of birds, again, is a token that there are
     Powers in heaven above who watch our proceedings in this world.
     Hence a well-known saying of our Lord's is by St. Ambrose^213
     as follows :

     "The birds of heaven do behold the face of My Father which is
     in heaven.' And the clause, ;Birds around the firmament of
     heaven,' intimates that the Powers which are in that visible
     space, behold all things in this region, and have all brought under
     the observation of their eyes."

     The waters flowing into the sea, are the people gathered into the
     Church Of Christ^214. Says St. Ambrose,

     "The water knows how to be gathered, how to shrink and flee away,
     when God gives the word.... Let us be like this water, let us
     recognise one congregation of the Lord, one only Church . . .. To us
     also it hath been said, ;Let the water be gathered from every
     valley,' and there hath ensued a spiritual gathering, and one
     people : the Church hath been replenished from among the heretics
     and heathens ..... This is the Church which hath been ;founded
     upon the seas, and prepared upon the floods.' For upon you it
     is established and prepared, who, like rivers run down into it,
     clean from a pure fountain : concerning which it is said, ;The
     floods have lift up, O Lord ; the floods have lift up their voice
     through the sound of many waters.' And it goes on,
     ;Wonderful are the swellings of the sea ; wonderful is the Lord
     in His high places.' Good rivers are ye for ye have drunk of
     that eternal and full fountain, wherein He flows who saith to you,
     ;He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture saith, out of his
     belly shall flow rivers of living water.'"

     In pursuance of this thought, the sound of the sea is the Church
     service^215.

     "What else is that concert of waves but a kind of concert of the
     people ? For which cause it is a true similitude, which is commonly
     made of the sea to a Church, first receiving or swallowing by all
     its porches certain waves of people entering in long array, then in
     the prayer of the whole congregation sounding as with refluent
     waves, when in harmony to the responsories of the Psalms an echo is
     made, a breaking of waves by the chanting of men and women, of
     virgins and children."

     (14.) Herbs again, and flowers, are the life and body of man. Says
     St. Basil^216 :

     "When thou seest a blade of grass or a flower, let it guide thee to
     the thought of human nature, remembering the image of the wise
     Prophet Isaiah, ;All flesh is grass and all the glory of man as
     the flower of grass.'"

     But this of course is too obvious to need dwelling on.

     Tares and weeds are false principles : not every kind of sin, but
     wrong and perverse teaching. Remarks the same St. Basil^217 :

     "Such spurious seeds are produced not by any change the seed-corn,
     but subsist by an origin of their own, having an appropriate kind.
     Yea, and they fulfil the image of those who adulterate the doctrines
     of the Lord, and in no genuine way become disciples of His word, but
     rather are corrupted by the teaching of the Evil One, yet mingle
     themselves with the healthful body of the Church."

     The smell of flowers is the odour of sanctity. Exclaims St.
     Ambrose^218 :

     "How great is the beauty of a well-stored field! What fragrance!
     What sweetness! What satisfaction to those who till it! How
     impossible to express it worthily, were we to use our own language!
     But we have certain testimonies Scripture, wherein we see that the
     fragrance of a field is compared to the blessing and grace of the
     Saints ; as saith holy Isaac, ;The smell of my son is like the
     smell of a field.'"

     Thorns on roses betoken the sting of pleasant sins, as says St.
     Basil^219 :

     "The rose at first beginning was thornless, but afterwards to the
     beauty of the flower the thorn also was superinduced ; that close to
     the delightfulness of pleasure we might have pain besetting us in
     every case, remembering sin, on account of which the earth was
     sentenced to put forth to us thorns and thistles."

     Grafting, in its several forms, is moral and devotional improvement.
     Says St. Basil^220 :

     "Let no one therefore, as yet living in evil, cast himself away in
     despair, knowing that as husbandry alters the qualities of plants,
     so the training of the soul according to virtue is capable of
     mastering every sort of distemperature."

     The myrica, or tamarisk, is the plant chosen by the Spirit through
     Jeremiah, as an emblem of a double mind : for "as such persons,"
     says St. Ambrose^221, "are every where at call, at once professing,
     with the good, kindness and simplicity, and connecting themselves as
     closely as possible with the worst of men : so also these shrubs, by
     a contradictory kind of rule, grow both in watery and in desert
     places."

     The palm is the chosen type of eternal purity.

     "[Other evergreens^222]---the olive, [for instance,] and the
     pine---never put off their apparel ; yet, however, they often
     change their leaves, which, keep the tree clothed in beauty, not by
     perpetual continuance, but by uninterrupted succession. But the palm
     remains ever green by the preservation and enduring, not the
     changeful succession, of its leaves. The very first which it put
     forth, it retains without substitution or fresh supply. Do thou
     then, O man, become like unto it, that to thee also it may be said,
     ;This thy stature is like unto a palm-tree.' Preserve the
     verdure of thy child hood, and of that natural innocence, which thou
     didst receive in the beginning : that, planted as thou art beside
     the rivers of waters, thou mayest have thy fruit prepared in thy
     season, and thy leaf may not fall. This verdure of ever-flourishing
     grace the Church having attained in Christ, saith, ;In His
     shadow I sat down with earnest desire.' This gift of verdure in
     the first instance the Apostles also received, that as no leaf of
     theirs could ever fall away, so their very shadow should be the
     healing of the sick."

     (15.) Proceeding to the works of the fourth day, we have another set
     of well-known symbols. The Sun, the greater light, is our Lord; the
     Moon, the lesser light, the Church. St. Ambrose tells us^223 :

     "He appointed the moon for certain seasons, and the Sun
     knoweth his going down.' This place appears to be commonly
     understood in a mystical sense concerning Christ and His Church : i.
     e. of our Lord's recognising His own death and passion in the
     body, when He said, ;Father the hour is come, do Thou glorify
     Thy Son :' that by such His setting He might give eternal life
     to all, who till then were oppressed with the setting of perpetual
     death ; that His Church might have her certain seasons, of
     persecution, namely, and of peace. For, like the moon, she seems to
     fail, but fails not indeed. She may be overshadowed, fail she
     cannot. Thus in persecutions some indeed depart, and cause her to
     wane, but it is in order to her being replenished by the confessions
     of martyrs ; and blood shed for Christ makes her bright with its
     triumphs, and her full orb pours forth more abundantly the glory of
     her devotion and faith. For the moon is subject to a diminution of
     her light, not of her orb . . . as may be easily seen when the air
     is pure and transparent."

     A little after he adds^224 :

     This is the true moon, which, from the never-failing light of her
     brother borrows for herself the lustre of immortality and grace. For
     the Church shineth not with her own but with Our Saviour's
     light, and draws to herself splendour from the Sun of Righteousness,
     that her word may be, ;It is no longer I that live, but Christ
     liveth in me.'"

     The Saints are stars in this mystical heaven, as we have seen, in a
     passage from St. Basil.

     The four quarters of the heaven again have their part in this sacred
     and universal language. What the east stands for is well known : and
     St. Ambrose, from a passage in Canticles, tells us that the south is
     the region of the Church^225.

     "Tell me, Thou whom my soul loveth, where Thou feedest, where Thou
     abidest in the south : [i. e. as he explains it,] in the region of
     the Church, where righteousness shines forth, where judgment is
     dazzling as the noon-day, where no shadow is seen, where the days
     are longer, because the Sun of Righteousness abides in them more
     continually, as in the summer months."

     And the east and south being interpreted, we know of course the
     probable interpretations of the two opposite regions ; which however
     shall not be dwelt on here, as they do not occur in the treatises
     now under consideration.

     (16.) Of the many instances which might be specified from among the
     works of the two remaining days, it will be enough only to mention
     three : two of them remarkable as having been constantly employed,
     by poets and moralists, to represent some portion of those truths,
     by association with which the Church has made them Mysteries. St.
     Basil uses the silkworm as an evidence or token of the
     Resurrection^226.

     "You, who disbelieve St. Paul, concerning the change when our bodies
     shall be raised, what say you on beholding so many of the
     inhabitants of the air, how they change their forms ? As we are told
     concerning that horned Indian worm, that it first changes into a
     grub, then goes on and becomes a chrysalis, and neither in this form
     does it abide, but decks itself with broad and light pinions. When
     ye women, therefore, sit carding out the produce of their work, I
     mean the threads which the Seres export to us for the manufacture of
     soft garments, I would have you take it as a manifest hint of the
     Resurrection, and not disbelieve the change which Paul announces to
     all men."

     Again, St. Ambrose sanctions the image, now almost trivial among us,
     of the turtle dove, as representing chaste and holy widowhood. Says
     he^227:

     "The Law of God, hath selected the turtle as a gift of chaste and
     pure sacrifice. In fact, when our Lord was circumcised, this was the
     offering : ;a pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.'
     For this is the true sacrifice of Christ : bodily chastity, and
     spiritual grace. Chastity is associated with the turtle, grace with
     the pigeon. For it is said that when the turtle has been widowed by
     the loss of her proper mate, she refuses to pair any more .... See
     how great is the grace of widowhood, which is honoured even in
     birds."

     One instance more may be mentioned, taken from among quadrupeds. The
     wolf is with St. Ambrose, as in Holy Scripture, the appropriate
     symbol of the Evil One, wasting the Church or besetting it. Upon
     this he observes (assuming common notions to be true)^228:

     If a wolf sees a man before he is seen, the sight takes away the
     man's voice ; but if he feel that the man saw him first, it
     takes away his fierceness, and he is unable to give chace.... Do
     beasts then know how to seek what shall profit them ; and art thou,
     O man, ignorant of thy proper helps ? Knowest thou not how to take
     away the courage of the Adversary, that as a wolf seen first he may
     not escape thee, that thine eye may discern his perfidy, and thou
     mayest be beforehand with him, and stay the course of his
     words,---blunt his audacity and sharpness of disputation.
     Whereas, if he anticipate thee, be takes away thy voice. . . .
     Again, if a wolf rise up against thee, take a stone, and he flies.
     Thy stone [of defence] is Christ. Betake thee to Christ, and the
     wolf flies, nor shall be be able to confound thee."

     Thus even popular and legendary sayings, on matters at first sight
     farthest from religion, were made to convey high lessons, and remind
     men of sacred duties.

     (17.) Perhaps this exemplification of the mystical use of all
     God's works, in the order of their creation, may be not unfitly
     crowned with mention of that Image of God, which, as St. Augustin
     explains, both in his books on the Trinity and in the City of God,
     man bears in his mind, even in every thought of it. Thus he speaks,
     in the later and more highly finished of the two works just
     mentioned :---after pointing out bow in all His creatures, and
     especially in the threefold division of knowledge, which even
     Gentile Philosophy acknowledged, God had left covert traces of the
     Father who made all, the Son by whom all were made, the Holy Spirit,
     or impersonated goodness, for whom all were made ;---he proceeds
     to say^229 :

     "And we even within ourselves acknowledge a certain image of God,
     even of that most High Trinity, at unspeakable distance indeed, yet
     such, that nothing among God's creatures is by nature more akin
     to Him ; and we expect yet a new creation, to bring it very near to
     Him by resemblance also. For, first, we are : secondly, we are
     conscious of being : thirdly, we delight in this our being and
     consciousness . . . ^230These three we hold for certain of our own ;
     we trust not for them to other people's testimony ; we
     ourselves feel them present, and discern them by an inward and most
     infallible kind of sight.

     "Because therefore we are men, made after the image of Him who
     created us, to whom appertains True Eternity, Eternal Truth, Love
     both Eternal and True; and He is the very Trinity, Eternal and True,
     and Beloved, neither confounded, nor separated : in those things of
     course which are beneath us, feeling as we do, that they neither
     could at all exist, nor be contained under any idea, nor either seek
     or maintain any order, except they were made by Him who in the
     highest sense Is, in the highest sense is Wise, in the highest sense
     is Good : let us trace out His footsteps, so to call them, impressed
     on all the things which He hath made, though on some more, on some
     less ; but in ourselves contemplating the Image of Him, even as that
     younger son in the Gospel, let us arise and return to ourselves, in
     order that we may return to Him, from whom by transgression we had
     withdrawn ourselves. There our being shall no longer incur death ;
     nor our knowledge error ; nor our love, disappointment^231."

     (15.) Yet further : as the soul of man appears to be, in this sense,
     an image of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity, so his body is
     divinely adapted to the expression of the several virtues and
     graces, which God would new-create in him. St. Ambrose, in the end
     of his treatise so often referred to, has worked out this idea in
     considerable detail. He says^232 :

     "The Forehead is an image of the soul, speaking in the countenance ;
     it is a sort of ground or tablet of Faith, on which day by day the
     Name of the Lord is inscribed and retained^233."

     Again, alluding to the Kiss of Peace in the Holy Communion^234, he
     says:

     "By the Lips, Piety and Charity are pledged, the faithful affection
     of entire love is expressed."

     Again^235 :

     "The Hand is that whereby we both work and dispense divine mysteries
     : by the name whereof the Son of God did not scorn to be designated,
     where David says, ;Thy right Hand, O Lord, hath wrought
     mightily : Thy right Hand, O Lord, hath exalted me.'"

     Thus he makes the Hand the symbol of active devotion.

     Lastly, the Foot by the same statement^236 expresses humility and
     diligent obedience.

     (19.) Upon these examples, taken collectively, one or two
     observations may be made.

     First, it will have been seen that the great majority of them, the
     most important, and those of which the writers speak most
     positively, are gathered out of Holy Scripture itself ; a
     circumstance which singly would afford some presumption, that in the
     rest of their imagery, not so immediately Scriptural, they did not
     altogether indulge their own private fancies.

     Again : if the figures used by any writer appear at first sight
     irreconcileable with those used by another, or by himself elsewhere
     : this also may be paralleled in Scripture, and in both will
     generally admit of explanations by tracing the original allusion a
     little farther back. E. g. Water, as is well known, is the o i k e i
     o n , the choice image, both in Scripture and in the Father's
     to express God's Holy Spirit communicated to His Church. But
     St. Ambrose, as we have seen, makes the same waters the emblem of
     Christ's people flowing into the Church : as St. Cyprian^237
     had done before him, where he teaches that the water in the
     Eucharistical cup is the token of the Christian people. But these
     two meanings are not inconsistent, if we conceive the Blessed Spirit
     to be graciously identifying Himself with the people whom He
     sanctifies ; representing the change wrought in them as so entire,
     that henceforth they, the whole being of each of them, may be
     considered as effects and gifts from Him. Or, if no such explanation
     occurred, still the incongruity would not be greater than that which
     is found in the different applications of this same symbol of water
     in the Holy Scripture itself : comparing, e. g. that living Water,
     which represents the Unspeakable Gift, with the waters on which the
     mystical Babylon sate, representing "nations, and kindreds, and
     peoples, and tongues."

     (20.) Thirdly, It may seem strange that some of these mystical
     allusions should be grounded on fable, not on fact : that to the
     Phoenix^238, for example, and to the conception of the Vulture^239
     without a mate (which is alleged in association with the Immaculate
     Conception). And the scorn is inexpressible, with which the old
     ecclesiastical writers, from St. Clement of Rome downwards, have
     been visited, among modern critics, on this ground especially.

     But in the first place, these supposed facts, many of them,- are
     brought forward not merely as providential intimations of mysterious
     Truths, but as arguments also from analogy, to silence gainsayers.
     St. Clement, for example, says in effect, "You believe this history
     of the Phoenix ; why should a resurrection be thought incredible by
     you ?" It is clear that the force of this depends not on the
     absolute truth of the statement, but on its general acceptance by
     those to whom he was addressing himself.

     Further; this also is one of those topics on which objectors had
     need look well to themselves, lest they find that unawares they have
     been dealing irreverently with the undoubted Word of God. What are
     we to make, on their principle, of the inspired direction to go to
     the ant, consider her ways, and imitate her forethought, now that ,
     it appears to be held among naturalists, that the common notion of
     that insect's frugality is no better than a common error^240 ?
     Whatever account can be given of that passage in Scripture, may be
     given, apparently, of like allegations, now found erroneous, in the
     writings of the Fathers.

     (21.) Lastly, no doubt a considerable number of the above cited
     instances of Mysticism in things visible, will appear to some very
     cold, strained, and unnatural. Of these, however, not a few will be
     found, on closer examination, to be no more than developments,
     applications, or extensions, of imagery authorized by Scripture
     itself, or by the Universal Church. And even where that cannot be
     made to appear, it is dangerous surely so to assume the contrary, as
     to indulge any light disrespectful thoughts of such similitudes or
     associations, or of the writers who pointed them out ; considering
     how many such things may unquestionably be found in God's own
     Word, which, if we lighted upon them in any other book, we should be
     tempted to treat with the same kind of disrespect. Here, as in every
     part of our patristical studies, it may be well to bear in mind the
     dream of Jacob, that we may not to our fear and shame have to awake
     by and by, and say, "Surely the Lord was with us in so many places,
     betokened by so many of His creatures, and we knew it not, but
     treated the thought unworthily."

         Â§ vii. Warrant of Scripture for the Mystical View of Things
                                   Natural.

     (1.) Enough, it is presumed, has been said on this subject, so far
     as mere illustration of the fact goes. The store of examples which
     has been adduced from two brief treatises only, the one by St.
     Basil, the other by St. Ambrose, on the six days' work of
     creation, must be enough to shew any attentive student, that if the
     Fathers were wrong in this matter, they were most perseveringly and
     obtrusively wrong. If the principle of Mystical Interpretation be at
     all an unhealthy symptom, it is so, not as a local evil, but as a
     constitutional taint.

     But it will be the object of this section to give some reasons for
     believing that such use of external things was intended by the
     Almighty from the beginning of the Creation; reasons taken from
     Scripture, and to be illustrated perhaps hereafter by the apparent
     ways of God's Providence, in preparing mankind for Gospel
     Truth.

     (2.) First, then, attention is desired to the use of the word a l h
     q i n o z , True ; in the New Testament. It will be found very
     significant, and to some may appear almost decisive, on the point
     now under consideration.

     Careful readers, of the Epistle to the Hebrews more especially, must
     have noticed how the things of the Christian Dispensation, as
     distinct from those of the Jewish, are characterized by this
     epithet, a l h q i n a . Thus our Saviour is designated as t v n a g
     i w n l e i t o u r g o z , k a i t h z a l h q i n h z , "a
     Minister of the Sanctuary, and of the True Tabernacle." And
     afterwards the holy places made with bands are spoken of as merely a
     n t i t u p a t v n a l h q i n v n , "Figures of the True^241." The
     word has evidently a relative signification : it implies the
     substance in opposition to the shadow ; answering perhaps most
     exactly to "real" in the language of the present day. And this
     agrees well enough with the classical use of it : e. g. in
     Aristotle's Ethics^242 : "To be well and rightly framed by
     Nature towards the pursuit of the best end, must be, if such a thing
     exist, h t e l e i a k a i a l h q i n h e u f u i a , perfect and
     real excellence of Nature :" implying evidently that there were
     spurious qualities, claiming that name improperly. And again, in the
     same author^243, "In our reasonings on practical matter, general
     statements are k o i n o t e r o i , ;more comprehensive,'
     but particular ones are a l h q i n w e r o i , ;have more of
     reality in them.'" So Demosthenes speaks of f i l o i a l h q i
     n o i , "true friends^244," and Polybius^245 of a l h q i n h p a i
     d e i a , "true discipline," as opposed to pretences of
     extraordinary warmth of affection, or skill in training.

     Such also will be found to be the force of the word in the LXX
     answering most frequently to the Hebrew substantive ___ much in the
     same usage as the substantive a l h q e i a , which, by the
     confession of all commentators, more especially in St. John, means
     the antitype as opposed to the type : "The Word dwelt among us, full
     of Grace and Truth :" "Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ :" "They
     that worship Him, must worship Him in Spirit and in Truth :" "Ye
     shall know the Truth and the Truth shall make you free :" "I am the
     Way, and the Truth, and the Life :" "When the Spirit of Truth is
     come, He shall guide you into all Truth." In all these places, and
     in others similar to them, the exposition of Theophylact seems to be
     generally received, "The word, Truth, may be understood by way of
     contrast to the old figures or types, which were not the Truth, o i
     t i n e z o u k h s a n a l h q e i a .

     With this notion on our rninds of the force of a l h q e i a and its
     kindred words, let us proceed to, examine such places as the
     following : "That was the True Light, t o f v z t o a l h q i n o n
     , which lighteneth every man that cometh into the world :" "I am the
     True Vine, h a m p e l o z h a l h q i n h ---and My Father is
     the Husbandman :" Moses gave you not that Bread from Heaven, but My
     Father giveth you the True Bread from Heaven : t o n a r t o n e k t
     o u o u r a n o u t o n a l h q i n o n :" "If ye have not been
     faithful in the unrighteous Mammon, who will commit to your trust
     the True Riches ?" t o a l h q i n o n t i z u m i n d w s e i ;
     "who will give you that which is real and true, not merely pretence
     and shadow ?"

     On these and the like places it seems natural to inquire, If the
     mention of the True Sanctuary, the True Tabernacle, the True Holy
     Place, leads us to think of those particulars, at least in the
     Jewish economy and ritual, as shadowy and typical of things far more
     real, far more perfect than themselves : does not the mention of the
     True Vine, the True Light, the True Riches, tend in the same manner
     to encourage a notion, that the external and visible objects, so
     referred to, have their counterpart in a world out of sight, wherein
     things exist in some manner secret to us, but as much more
     substantial and excellent than the mode of their being here, as the
     things of the Gospel and Church of Christ are better than those of
     the Law and Tabernacle of Moses ? As it was not possible for a
     thoughtful believing person, having once heard of the True
     Tabernacle, to consider that which stood in the wilderness as any
     other than an unreal figure of the true ; so when the Holy Spirit
     had spoken to men of the True Light, faithful hearers must have
     learned thenceforth to have far other and higher associations with
     this light which we see, than they could have had otherwise. They
     know that it is now but a faint earthly shadow of a radiance as much
     more real than itself, as it is purer and more unspeakably glorious.
     And so of the other instances, in which the same form of speaking is
     implied.

     But further : as the mention of the Sanctuary and Tabernacle, the
     Ark and certain other particulars, must of course lead reflecting
     minds, even without further information, to the surmise, that in
     regard likewise of other points not specified, and in short in its
     whole range and detail, the Jewish economy was typical of the
     Christian ; so when the True Light and the True Vine are named, we
     are naturally carried on to say to ourselves, "What, if the whole
     scheme of sensible things be figurative ? What, if all a i s q h t a
     answer to n o h t a in the same kind of way as these which are
     expressly set down ? What, if these are but a slight specimen of one
     great use which Almighty God would have us make of the external
     world, and of its relation to the world spiritual?"

     Certainly the form itself of speaking, with which these symbols are
     introduced would seem to imply some such general rule : "That was
     the True Light;" "I am the True Vine;" "who will give you the True
     Riches?" taking for granted in a manner the fact, that there was
     somewhere in the nature of things a true counterpart of these
     ordinary objects,---a substance, of which they were but unreal
     shadows,---and only informing us in each case, with authority,
     what that counterpart and substance was.

     Should it further appear, that among those to whom the Scriptures
     were addressed, there existed a feeling or opinion, call it poetical
     or philosophical, or let it have been a mere popular fancy, that
     such a connexion as this language seems to point to really exists
     between the worlds visible and invisible; the argument for the
     proposed interpretation of the word alhqinon , would seem to be so
     far strengthened. We may reason here as about real possession by
     DÃ¦mons. The more popular the opinion, the less likely, surely, to
     and countenance in the language of inspiration, if it were an error.

     Now it would seem, that to one large class at least, of those to
     whom the writings of St. John were at first addressed,---the
     Hellenistical Jews, of Alexandria,---this doctrine of
     correspondence between things seen and unseen was familiar and very
     acceptable.

     (3.) But not to pursue this topic further at present ; let it be
     considered, whether there are not, on the face of Scripture itself,
     other obvious appearances in its favour. In the first place, there
     is the broad fact, that the revealed oracles deal so largely, I had
     almost said so unreservedly, in symbolical language taken from
     natural objects : and next, what is equally obvious, that the chosen
     vehicle for the most direct divine communications has always been
     that form of speech, which most readily adopts and invites such
     imagery ; viz. the Poetical. These are undeniable and surely most
     significant circumstances, and hardly to be accounted for by the
     sayings of those, who would reduce all Mysticism to the mere
     workings of human fancy. Let us reflect, distinctly and at large, on
     each of them.

     And first, as to the symbolical language of Scripture, is there not
     something very striking, to a thoughtful reverential mind, in the
     simple fact of such language occurring there at all ? This is not
     meant of merely metaphorical and figurative language, expressing one
     human and temporal matter by another ; but the case intended is,
     when truths supernatural are represented in Scripture by visible and
     sensible imagery. Consider what this really, comes to. The Author of
     Scripture is the Author of Nature. He made His creatures what they
     are, upholds them in their being, modifies it at His will, knows all
     their secret relations, associations, and properties. We know not
     how much there may be, far beyond mere metaphor and similitude, in
     His using the name of any one of His creatures, in a translated
     sense, to shadow out some thing invisible. But thus far we may seem
     to understand, that the object thus spoken of by Him is so far taken
     out of the number of ordinary figures of speech, and resources of
     language, and partakes thenceforth of the nature of a Type.

     For what is it, wherein our idea of a Scriptural Type differs from
     that of a mere illustration or analogy ? It appears to lie chiefly
     in these two things : first, that the event or observance itself, to
     which we annex the figurative meaning, was ordered, we know, from
     the beginning, with reference to that meaning : next, that the ideas
     having been once associated with each other, by authority of
     God's own Word, reverential minds shall never thereafter be
     able to part with that association ; the sign will to them
     habitually prove a remembrance and token of the thing signified :
     and this also must have been intended in the first sanctioning of
     the type, being the inevitable result, in all minds that fear God,
     and watch for the signs of His presence. Thus Abraham's
     sacrifice of Isaac, for example, had it been related only by
     Josephus, might well have been used by way of similitude or
     comparison to illustrate the sacrifice of God's only begotten
     Son on the same mountain, two thousand years after : but it is not
     clear that we could have positively called it a Type.

     That which warrants us in doing so, is the constant interpretation
     of the Church, confirming the thought which would naturally enter
     into good and considerate hearts on reading of it, in the
     Scriptures.

     Now let us transfer this notion of a Type, from historical events
     related in Scripture, to such allusions as are now in
     question---allusions to the works of nature, and the outward face
     of things. There also the same distinction is clearly conceivable.
     Let an uninspired poet or theologian be never so ingenious in his
     comparisons between earthly things and heavenly, we cannot build any
     thing upon them ; there is no particular certainty, much less any
     sacredness in them : but let the same words come out of the mouth of
     God, and we know that the resemblance was intended from the
     beginning, and intended to be noticed and treasured up by us ; it is
     therefore very nearly the case of a Type properly so called.

     We read, for example, that Christ "Was the True Light which
     lighteneth every man that cometh into the world." This, perhaps, in
     some part of its sense, might be an image not unlikely to have
     occurred to an earthly orator, and we might have profited by it, as
     expressive and edifying, and there would be an end :---but now we
     are informed by it, that even in the first creation of the material
     light, God had respect to this our spiritual Light; the one was
     designedly formed to be an image of the other ; and such an image as
     believers should recognise, having their attention drawn to the
     resemblance by the Word of God Himself. May we not then apply the
     same term in this case as in the former, and may we not say that the
     Light visible is a natural Type of God manifesting Himself by His
     Son, as Isaac on the mountain was an historical Type of our Lord
     yielding Himself to the death of the Cross?

     (4.) Now if there were in the Book of God but one such image taken
     from the works of nature, it might cause in thoughtful minds a
     serious apprehension, that other cases might exist, of a like
     intended resemblance between the worlds visible and invisible,
     though none of them were as yet clearly and expressly declared to
     us. Our natural tendency to express things unseen by what we see,
     would seem to have acquired a real though slight sanction and
     warrant from above : and we might without irreverence begin to
     speculate (if the word may be used,) on other possible associations
     and mysterious meanings.

     Indeed we should be almost driven to such speculations, in the case
     supposed, of earthly and heavenly Light. The idea of Light
     necessarily implies that of its opposite, Darkness ; and naturally,
     to beings framed and conditioned as we are, it implies also the
     ideas, of morning and evening, sun, moon, and stars, shadow and
     sunshine, twilight increasing and decreasing, and many others : for
     all which, many would be inclined to imagine counterparts in the
     spiritual world, after they had been once made aware that the Light
     itself was intended to be typical.

     Now, on further examination of the Scriptures, they would find these
     their anticipations verified. They would find that as Light was the
     regular symbol of Him, by whom the Father is manifested, who is God
     of God, Light of Light, the Word who hath declared the Invisible ;
     so is the Sun in the heavens the scriptural token of the Word
     Incarnate, "coming forth as a bridegroom out of His chamber, and
     rejoicing as a Giant to run His course." They would find the
     condition of the world without Christ represented as "darkness
     covering the earth, and gross darkness the people ;" the dawnings of
     His manifestation, when incarnate but yet unborn, compared to the
     morning twilight or "dayspring from on high :" and the severe trials
     and apparent failures of the faith, which are to be expected even
     under ,the Gospel dispensation, these they would find compared to an
     evening twilight, endeavouring to prevail, but overcome by the sun
     which never sets : as we read, "At evening time there shall be
     light."

     Other passages would shew them, the Moon as the chosen emblem of
     mortal imperfect human nature, reflecting more or less of the Light
     which flows from Christ, less in the Synagogue, more in the Church
     of the Now Testament: and again the stars, as lesser, lights,
     Patriarchs, Apostles, Bishops, such as are any how employed in
     turning many to righteousness. Eclipses, rainbows, and other
     phenomena might be added.

     (5.) But if the one idea of light and darkness, with their various
     relations and modifications, were found thus, from beginning to end,
     allegorized, not by our imaginations, but by Scripture itself
     ;---one might reasonably conclude the like in the case also of
     the other great and leading parts and attributes of the material
     world : one might without presumption infer details and particulars,
     where express, Scripture gave only the general and comprehensive
     statement. Thus if we only found the Church called generally, the
     Vineyard of the Lord, His pleasant field, and the like, we might
     reason on the processes of cultivation, the marks of a good or
     unwholesome stock, the tokens of wrath and favour though we nowhere
     read such parables as those of Isaiah and our Lord, developing the
     idea with authority.

     If one of two contraries were clearly Symbolical, the other would be
     understood to be so likewise : if good seed and noble vines are
     God's obedient and accepted ones, there would be no need to
     tell us that weeds and thorns and tares are the children of the
     Wicked One.

     Where two things are by nature inevitably and inseparably related to
     each other, if Scripture give us the spiritual force of the one, it
     should seem hardly possible to avoid inferring that of the other.
     Thus if God's regenerate ones, taken separately, are as good
     seeds cast into the ground, the loaf which comes of that good seed,
     stands naturally for the same persons formed into one Church or
     company : an imagination proved to be a verity by the double
     offering sanctioned in God's law, first of ears of corn,
     afterwards of consecrated loaves---and this, (to anticipate
     another part of our subject) is an example of the manner in which
     God's ancient ritual gives apparent sanction to the symbolical
     use of things natural.

     (6.) Now considering to what an extent nature (so to speak,)
     delights in pairs, and groupings, and relations; how "one thing," as
     the son of Sirach observes, is every where set against another ;"
     how impossible it is to find an object single and uncombined with
     all others, or to limit the extent of the associations and
     connexions, which manifest themselves one after another, when we set
     about tracing any one of the works of creation, through all its
     influences and aspects on the rest ; it ought not perhaps to seem
     over strange, if the symbolical and mystical use of any one thing
     were thought to imply the possibility at least of a similar use and
     bearing in all things.

     And this presumption will evidently be strengthened, as the
     instances which Holy Scripture furnishes multiply, and as we find,
     on more and more acquaintance with it, that its typical allusions
     are more developed, and come out on its surface, as stars meet the
     eye more abundantly, when we continue gazing for any time on what
     seemed at first merely a space of open sky. St. Augustine appears to
     have been particularly gifted with the power of discerning this kind
     of holy imagery. It is really, wonderful, as one reads his descants,
     on the Psalms more especially, how many allusions he detects and
     brings out, with more or less ingenuity in the particular instance ;
     so that it must require, one would think, a mind prepossessed
     altogether with dislike of the principle of Mysticism, not to be
     carried away with him. But even without stopping to discern these
     more latent allusions, it should seem that on the very surface of
     Scripture so many of the chief visible objects are invested with
     spiritual meanings, that to affirm the same of the whole world of
     sense ought not to sound too hard a saying. The symbols which are
     mentioned are almost enough to make up between them "a new heaven
     and a new earth," and to complete the proof, that "the first heaven
     and the first earth" are to be regarded both generally and in their
     parts, as types and shadows of those which are out of sight.

     On this head there appears something instructive in the circumstance
     that the phrase just referred to, "a new heaven and a new earth,"
     occurs both in the Old and in the New Testament at the very
     conclusion of a great body of Prophecy^246, in the course of which
     the imagery of the visible world has been, one may say, unreservedly
     employed to represent the scenes and transactions of the invisible
     one. That is, after the devout mind has been accustomed in detail to
     associations of that kind, comes in the most comprehensive phrase
     that could be employed, apparently confirming, by the Creator's
     authority, the view of creation, thus become familiar. Perhaps it
     adds something to the argument, that in the second instance the
     phrase occurs within a few sentences of the conclusion of the whole
     Bible.

     (7.) Nominalists however of various classes are ready enough with
     their solutions of these appearances. They say, "it is the
     imperfection of language ; the Almighty Himself condescending to
     employ human words and idioms, could no otherwise convey ideas of
     the spiritual world, than by images and terms taken from objects of
     sense." Or again, "it is the genius of Orientalism : if God
     vouchsafed to address the men of any particular time or country, He
     would adopt the modes of speech suited to that time and country." Or
     "the whole is mere poetical ornament, the vehicle of moral or
     historical truth, framed to be beautified and engaging in its kind,
     in mere indulgence to the infirmity of human nature."

     But as to the particular point in question, would it not be enough
     to say, in answer to all these statements together, that even if
     granted in fact, they fail as explanations? since the question would
     immediately occur, Who made Language, or Orientalism, or Poetry,
     what they respectively are ? Was it not One, who knew beforehand
     that He should adopt them one day, as the channel and conveyance of
     His truth and His will to mankind ? Surely, reason and piety teach
     us, that God's providence prepared language in general, and
     especially the languages of Holy Scripture, and the human styles of
     its several writers, as fit media through which his supernatural
     glories and dealings might be discerned: and if they be so formed as
     necessarily to give us notions of a certain correspondence between
     the supernatural and the visible, we can hardly help concluding that
     such notions were intended to be formed by us ; except there be some
     direct text, or strong analogy of faith, against it.

     (8.) It is not very easy to see what is gained by the very rigorous
     mode of interpretation, which some would apply to the phraseology of
     the Bible. Illustrations, they say, and analogies, are never to be
     pressed a hair's breadth further than the least which the
     context itself, and the turn of the reasoning or sentiment, makes
     absolutely necessary. We must never be contented till we have
     exhausted them, as nearly as possible, of all supernatural meaning :
     just as the same people count it an axiom, that in historical
     narratives there must be as few miracles, and in Church ceremonies
     as few sacraments, as may be.

     These rules hardly approve themselves to natural piety, which is
     ever anxious to trace God as near at hand as it can, alike in His
     words and in His works. Neither do they well agree with the manner
     in which the Old Testament is commented on in the New, nor with the
     sort of expansion and development in detail, which subsequent
     passages not seldom furnish, of an idea only just thrown out at
     first. In short, it seems equally absurd to say, on the one band,
     that the minimum of mystical sense is always to be preferred, as it
     would be on the other, always to be trying to extract as much of it
     as ever we can :---equally absurd, and perhaps not quite so
     reverential. Surely it will always be a question of degree, not so
     much how far each sensible image has some spiritual meaning, as how
     far we are able to extract that meaning with any sort of certainty
     or satisfaction ; saving, as was just now said, the analogy of faith
     and the truth of other Scriptures. Certainly there is no very
     obvious reason why we should incline to the defect, rather than the
     excess in this matter.

     (9.) Waving, however, these remarks, which would seem to render all
     attempts of the kind nugatory, let us see how the Bible imagery will
     accommodate itself to the particular theories above mentioned, of
     those who would resolve it into mere accidents of language. First,
     if the whole were mere necessity, arising out of the imperfection of
     human speech ; or if it were oriental boldness of phrase, or
     poetical ornament; the symbols would probably be more varied than we
     find them to be : the same external object would not so constantly
     occur, to express the same invisible thing, through so large a
     collection of compositions, so widely differing in style and tone.
     As to the imperfection of human speech, we all feel every hour how
     it causes us to modify and alter our images : we take the best
     symbol which occurs at the time, but we use it in a kind of restless
     unsatisfied way, like persons aware that it is not simply the best;
     and by the time we need it again, we have lighted very likely on
     something far truer and more vivid : and thus, we go on in
     conversation or in writing, improving or marring our imagery, as the
     case may be, but still letting it be felt that it is by no means
     fixed and unchangeable.

     Again, as to poetical ornament, variety and versatility of resource
     is obviously a great ingredient of that sort of excellency : to be
     always resorting to the same similitude or analogy would rather of
     course betray want of skill or power.

     The third solution, that of Orientalism, may seem at first sight to
     be more satisfactory as to this particular circumstance, of the same
     figure constantly repeated. Granting, however, that the literature
     of the Eastern nations is in some respects, like their manners, more
     fixed and monotonous than ours, and accordingly, that it uses to
     express things out of sight by a certain uniform imagery, suggesting
     the notion of a settled and understood allegory : yet in the first
     place, we know not how far this literature may have been originally
     modeled on the Hebrew Scriptures, instead of their taking any tone
     from some previous form of it, the very existence of which, after
     all, is but conjectural. Next, such a statement would put in a
     stronger light the fact of that kind of style having been adopted by
     the Holy Ghost, whereby its symbolical words would seem to be raised
     to the rank of Divine Hieroglyphics, so to call them. And thirdly,
     except we suppose such a foundation of truth in them, it seems hard
     to explain the sanction given to them by the writers of the New
     Testament, using as they did a language, and applying themselves
     (St. Paul and St. Luke especially) to a condition of literature and
     society, well nigh the opposites of what this theory supposes to
     have existed in Asia and the East.

     The fixedness therefore of the Scriptural Imagery does not appear to
     be sufficiently accounted for by any criticism of this kind : but it
     is accounted for, if we suppose the material world originally
     constructed with a view to the sacred analogies which this
     symbolical alphabet of Scripture (if we may so denominate it)
     suggests.

     (10.) But here an objection occurs, of no small moment. The fact may
     perhaps be denied, that the symbols of Scripture are so fixed and
     regular, as this part of our argument Supposes. And the authority of
     St. Augustin may be appealed to, who seems to lay down a rule at
     first sight inconsistent with it. He says^247:

     "Because, there are a variety of ways in which one thing may appear
     to resemble another, we are not to imagine it a set-rule,
     ;Whatsoever in any one place any thing has stood for in the way
     of simile, that we are always to account its signification.'
     For the image of leaven has been employed by the Lord Himself, both
     in the way of reproof, as when He said, ;Beware of the leaven
     of the Pharisees,' and in the way of praise, when He said,
     ;The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a woman which hid leaven,
     in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.'"

     And then he proceeds to point out that this variety of symbolical
     meaning may be in all degrees.

     "The same thing may sometimes stand for contraries, here in a good
     sense, there in a positively bad one, as in the instance just
     mentioned of leaven ; or again, as the lion is the emblem of Christ.
     The lion of the Tribe of Judah hath prevailed and it is the emblem
     also of the Devil ; ;He goeth about as a roaring lion, seeking
     whom be may devour:' so the serpent, now in a good sense;
     ;Be ye wise as serpents;' and now in a bad one; ;The
     serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty:'---Bread, in a
     good sense; ;I am the living Bread, which came down from Heaven
     ;' and in a bad one, ;Bread eaten in secret is
     pleasant.' And there are many other such.

     "Now of these which I hive mentioned, the signification is not
     doubtful : because, our object being to exemplify, none but clear
     cases could properly be introduced. But there are also some whereof
     it is doubtful what turn we ought to give them : as, ;In the
     hand of the Lord there is a cup of pure wine, full mixed.' For
     here it is doubtful, whether he means the anger of God, stopping
     short of the last penalty, i. e. not exhausted quite to the dregs ;
     or rather, the grace of the Scriptures passing from Jew to Gentiles,
     expressing by Inclinavit ex hoc in hoc : ;He hath stooped it
     away from this side, and entirely towards that :' there
     remaining with the Jews only the outward observances, whereof, they
     have but a carnal understanding : and to this purpose may be,
     ;The dregs thereof are not emptied.'"

     Proceeds St. Augustin:

     "But thirdly, the same thing is sometimes spoken of not absolutely
     in contrary, but only in diverse meanings; as water signifying both
     the people:---as we read in the Apocalypse, ;The waters
     where the whore sitteth are peoples, and multitudes, and nations,
     and tongues:' and the Holy Spirit ; whence is that saying,
     ;Out of His belly shall flow rivers of living water:' and
     so there may be other things here and there, whereof water is
     understood to be the emblem, according to the context of the places
     where it occurs."

     Thus far St. Augustin : but when his instances come to be examined,
     it will be found perhaps that his differences of signification may
     be all reduced to different shades or aspects of the same meaning.
     The Leaven, whether it be bad or good, equally represents moral
     impressions silently communicated from one to another : the Lion
     represents a royal warrior, the Serpent, one who counsels deeply and
     craftily, be their nature and their cause what it may : Bread is
     that which satisfies the cravings of the soul, in its healthy or in
     its diseased state : Wine in God's Hand (the allusion is too
     sacred to be expressed without fear and hesitation,) may,
     consistently with the rest of Holy Scripture, be interpreted of the
     highest and most mysterious of all privileges, which is either life
     or death as men choose to receive it. Of water in its several
     meanings we shall speak presently.

     (11.) But now, if the expression of different objects by the same
     symbol, which St. Augustin thus largely illustrates, is
     reconcileable with the general uniformity of the scriptural imagery,
     much more the converse of it ; I mean when the same object is
     represented by different symbols. To take the highest and most
     obvious, and also the most frequent example: our Lord Christ in His
     several offices and relations may be represented by symbols as
     different from each other as a Lamb and a Lion, the Sun in Heaven
     and a Vine among trees, a Serpent of brass or a Stone cut out of a
     mountain : and yet no violence be done to, the harmony (so to call
     it) of the symbolical language : not only things positively unlike
     may answer well enough to each in the way of analogy, and so may
     represent Him in someone of His relations ; but also because it is
     reasonable to think, that the whole creation can hardly be too large
     or too various to shadow out His manifold aspects, who is all in all
     to every one of His creatures.

     In the greatest possible variety, whether of objects typified by one
     symbol, or of symbols typifying the same object, there must still be
     substantial uniformity, because all point or converse towards Him,
     His work and His everlasting kingdom : just as all languages,
     however unlike in sound and structure, must be made up virtually of
     the same parts of speech, having to express the same mental
     processes, and the same external world.

     (12.) With regard then to both grounds of scruple, we may thankfully
     acquiesce in the practical rule of St. Augustin^248.

     "When from the same words of Holy Writ not one single meaning, but
     two or more occur to our minds ; though we know not what was in the
     mind of him who wrote the words, there is no danger, if it can be
     shown from other passages of the Holy Scriptures that either one of
     these senses is in harmony with the truth ; provided always that the
     person engaged in searching out the Divine Words make this his
     object, to come at the meaning of the author, by whose agency the
     Holy Ghost wrought out this Scripture. Either this, I say, he must
     attain, or be must frame some other meaning out of those words, not
     opposed to the right faith, providing himself with authority from
     some other portion of God's Word. For possibly the author
     himself saw the same meaning in the passage we wish to explain ; and
     certainly, at least, the Spirit of God, Who by him composed those
     words, foresaw that it would occur to the reader or hearer ; nay, He
     took care that it should occur, seeing that it also, by hypothesis,
     rests on the truth. For what larger or more abundant provision could
     have been made by Divine care in the authoritative words of God,
     than for the same words to be capable of more acceptations than one,
     other sayings no less Divine testifying to the same, and demanding
     our approbation for them?"

     Thus far St. Augustin; and it seems well worth consideration,
     whether there be not somewhat in the ordinary experience of us all,
     to confirm his view, high and transcendental as it is. Consider how
     very differently the same words sound in our ears, according to our
     different moods of mind ; how much more meaning we find, not only in
     a text of Scripture, but in a chance passage of a book or a stray
     remark of a friend, when we recall it by and by, more seriously than
     at first we listened to it ; nay, and how much beyond what we
     suspected we discover occasionally in our own words, uttered perhaps
     at first by instinct, we hardly knew how : so that not only are we
     always uncertain whether any two persons receive exactly the same
     impression---the same moral impression, that is, from any given
     words, but even whether, to the same person the same ideas are
     conveyed by them twice. And yet there is truth and definite meaning
     in the words so spoken, although they go so much deeper with one man
     than they do with another. Surely then it ought not to seem strange
     that the words of the Most High, spoken with full knowledge of the
     thoughts of all who should read or hear them, should be intended to
     give out more or less of signification according to our preparation
     of heart ; and that, in that sense, their meanings should be even
     infinite in number and variety. It is only the fact which our own
     experience suggests, applied to the case of those sayings which are
     inspired.

     Again; we know well that our good and serious moods are those, in
     which we most surpass ourselves in our apprehension of deep and
     grave sayings ; and what is this in effect, but St. Augustin's
     remark, "That practice strengthened by the exercise of
     piety---usus pietatis exercitatione roboratus---will greatly
     aid us in coming to a true signification ?" Well is it for those,
     who are able to confirm this, from the help which they have found in
     pure imaginations, and rightly tuned affections, rather than
     contrariwise, from the hindrance they have brought on themselves by
     indulging base and frivolous fancies. But in one way or the other,
     we must all more or less have experienced it.

     (13.) Further, one may conceive a person arguing, that this view is
     dangerous and apt to unsettle foundations, making ail doctrines
     subjective rather than objective; true to the individual, not true
     in themselves. There is obviously danger of this ; but here too the
     experience we have appealed to will help us. Great as the interval
     may be between one man and another in their understanding of a given
     passage,---or between our own ordinary perception of it, and that
     which we enjoy when our thoughts are most elevated and
     refined,---yet these variations are all within certain limits :
     the imagery tends all in the same general direction, though some go
     never so much deeper, higher, wider, than others : just as we do not
     question the real significancy of words, or the existence of
     coloured objects, because we are not sure that the shades of meaning
     or of colour are quite the same to any two different minds. The
     Catholic Faith, the Mind of Christ testified by His universal
     Church, limits the range of symbolical interpretation both in
     Scripture and in nature : the Protestant watchword, Verbum Dei, must
     be made primitive by the constant addition, Verbum Deus : or, as St.
     Augustin again expresses it, "We that are made the Body of Christ,
     let us not fail to recognise our own voice in the Psalms and other
     Scriptures :" our own voice, because it is the Voice of Him in whom
     we are all made one. "Christ," he proceeds, "wheresoever in those
     Books, wheresoever in those Scriptures I am journeying and panting
     for breath, in that sweat of our face which is part of our sentence
     as men,---Christ is there, openly or secretly to meet and refresh
     me. It is He Himself, who, by the very difficulty which I sometimes
     have in finding Him, inflames my longing, so that what I do find of
     His I may eagerly suck in, and retain to my soul's health,
     absorbed in my very joints and marrow." And, "In reading the
     Scriptures, he only, who finds no pleasure in these holy
     manifestations of Christ, is turned unto fables, not enduring sound
     doctrine." In other words, the analogy of faith, Christ set before
     us in the Creeds of the Church, will give a fixedness and reality to
     our symbolical interpretations, how wide soever in other respects
     the latitude and variety which seems to be allowed in them.

     It need only just be mentioned that the apparent double or manifold
     senses of a great portion of the Prophecies, and the manner in which
     the New Testament generally accommodates, as it is called, texts
     from the Old, obviously harmonize with what has been advanced out of
     St. Augustin on this head.

     (14.) Closely connected with this topic, of the fixedness of the
     sacred symbols, is what may be called their complexity ; the manner
     in which, not seldom, the primary and simple ones among them are
     varied and combined, as letters are combined into syllables, words,
     and sentences, retaining each somewhat of their original sound : or
     rather, as those compound derivatives which are made up of
     significant terms, each term modified, not changed, in its import.
     To take an example, than which none can be more holy and venerable,
     none, as it may seem, more unquestionable. The appropriate symbol of
     the Holy Spirit is, as the name implies, Breath---the Breath of
     the Father and the Son, omnipresent, all powerful : and hence it is
     sometimes represented by the air or wind, as in our Lord's well
     known words to Nicodemus, and when the disciples on the day of
     Pentecost heard a sudden sound as of a rushing mighty wind ; and His
     function as the Lord and Giver of Life is represented by the gift of
     respiration to living things. "God breathed into man's nostrils the
     breath of life, and man became a living soul ;" and "when He letteth
     His breath go forth, they are made; and He reneweth the face of the
     earth."

     But breath has not only in it air, but moisture; and this condensed
     is first clouds, then drops of rain, then water gushing out in
     springs, or flowing in rivers ; or in a way of approach yet more
     silent and invisible, dew : and all these are scriptural emblems of
     the Holy Spirit ; in Its several aspects and relations. The
     overshadowing and guiding cloud, in which as well as in the Red Sea,
     the Israelites were baptized unto Moses, was a token, we know from
     St. Paul, of the descent of the regenerating Spirit of Christ, with
     a hovering, brooding motion, like that of a dove, first on our Lord
     Himself, then on each of His Members at their baptism : its
     appearing over the Tabernacle in glory, and filling both it and the
     Temple, prefigured the warmth and brightness of the heavenly
     Comforter, diffusing Itself over the whole Church at once, and
     entering into every corner of the new-born soul : the descent of a
     cloud in rain or dew, is the Spirit communicating Himself in gifts
     and sanctifying graces ; becoming (if one may so speak,) water for
     the nourishment of our souls, as He was air to give them life ;
     according to that verse in the Psalm, "Thou, O Lord, sentest a
     gracious rain upon Thine inheritance, and refreshedst it when it was
     weary :" and it may be that the express words of the Holy Ghost are
     compared to distinct drops of rain, and His silent promptings to the
     dews, more aÃ«rial and impalpable. So, Moses, "My doctrine," my set
     and formal instructions, "shall drop as the rain ; my speech," my
     incidental hints and whispers, "shall distil as the dew."

     The fountains again and depths of pure water, gushing out for our
     purification and refreshment, how or from whence we know not, except
     that we are sure they are originally derived from above,---these
     are the Holy Ghost in His larger communications of baptismal,
     sacramental grace; opening fountains in the hard dry heart of man,
     which seem to belong to it, but are entirely the gatherings of His
     rain. And this image is kept up even to the final description of the
     Church's glory; where, as it should seem, the goings forth of
     the Comforter are typified by "a pure river of water of life,
     proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb," with the Tree
     of Life growing beside it for the hearing and quickening of the
     nations. And indeed all that is said in every part of the
     Scriptures, concerning the righteous as trees of the Lord's
     planting, the Church as His vineyard, the wicked as corrupt and wild
     plants,---in itself one of the plainest and most abundant of all
     the sources of scriptural parables,---combines wonderfully well
     with the thought of air and water, as emblems of the life-giving,
     sanctifying Breath of the Most High.

     On the other hand, as the Breath of God thus becomes water, to
     cherish, and refresh, and cleanse those souls which have not
     forfeited the Divine Life, so in It's severer influences, either to
     purify or consume, (for purgation is partial consuming,) It becomes
     fire from heaven : first to try, and prove, and refine, every
     man's work here ; next, utterly to destroy and waste what shall
     be found vile and refuse hereafter. Thus He who is a consuming fire,
     and who had so shewn Himself on Mount Sinai, and on so many other
     occasions when the ungodly were to perish at His presence ; He made
     His coming known by cloven tongues like as of fire, when that flame
     was to be kindled which Christ came to send upon the earth : and we
     have an awful notice given, that it is "the Breath of the Lord,"
     which "as a stream of brimstone, kindles" the fire which is
     "ordained of old" and "prepared for the devil and his angels."

     Thus remarkably does the one idea of the Breath of the Lord,
     followed up and variously combined with others, explain almost all
     the principal symbols used in Scripture to denote the influences and
     operations of the Holy Spirit of God. Surely the Ancient Church was
     justified in thinking that analogies so uniformly kept up, and at
     the same time so elaborate and complex, were intended for something
     beyond mere poetical ornament. When, with hearts and memories full
     of Scripture, they looked out on Nature and her operations, they
     could not but be conscious that the lessons which they had read and
     heard were perpetually coming before them in what they saw: and how
     was it possible for them to help believing that the association was
     providential and divine; they who were accustomed to behold
     God's hand in far lesser and more ordinary things?

     (15.) Besides, they found this kind of correspondence repeatedly
     taken for granted and reasoned on in the Holy Scripture itself. Did
     they not see how St. Paul works out in the minutest detail the
     notion of the Church being the Body of Christ? how he teaches us to
     deduce from it our every day duties and relations to each other? And
     could they doubt that all this was intended, in the first formation
     of the human body, by Him who caused all things to be for the
     Church's sake? In these analogies unfolded by St. Paul, and
     still more strikingly in our Lord's Parables, they would
     perceive the principle sanctioned, and the means afforded, of
     spiritualizing all the chief objects and processes of which common
     life, and the world of sense, are made up: and they would think
     themselves justified in reverently carrying on these analogies,
     according to their skill, to other points of detail, not expressly
     mentioned in Scripture.

     As an example, take St. Augustin's comment on an exquisite
     pastoral image in the Song of Solomon. He is not, observe, reasoning
     in proof of our principle, that was always taken for granted by the
     Fathers, but he is descanting on the beauty and usefulness of it. He
     asks^249 :

     Why is the hearer less, delighted, when he is told literally of holy
     and perfect men, whose life and conduct are the means, whereby
     Christ's Church separates those who come to her from all
     superstitions, and unites them, imitating the good which they see,
     to her own body, which same good and faithful and true servants of
     God have cast off the burthens of the world, and have drawn near to
     the Holy Laver of Baptism, and going up from thence, are now,
     through the quickening Spirit, bearing the fruit of both kinds of
     love, the love of God and of our neighbour :---why is it, I say,
     that the literal statement of these things affords less satisfaction
     to the hearer, than if one expound to the same effect that verse in
     the Song of Songs, where it is said to the Church, receiving praise
     under the similitude of a beautiful woman, ;Thy teeth are like
     a flock of sheep even shorn, which are gone up from the washing,
     which every one of them bear twins, and there is none barren among
     them ?' Certainly the instruction one receives is in substance
     no more, than in listening to the former statement, made as it was
     in the most literal words, without the support of this similitude.
     And yet there is, I know not how, an additional pleasure in
     contemplating those saints, when I see them, quasi denies EcclesiÃ¦,
     cutting off men from their native errors, and transferring them in a
     manner into the substance of her body, divided into morsels, and
     champed, and their hardness mollified. Again, I recognise with great
     delight the sheep newly shorn, their earthly burthens, as fleeces,
     deposited, and going up from the bath, i. e., from Baptism. I see
     how they all bring forth twins, the two commandments, namely, of
     love ; and not one of them is barren of that holy fruit."

     This, it will he observed, is produced by St. Augustin himself as a
     specimen of the mode of interpretation, which the Church in his time
     received undoubtingly, as the true mind of the Spirit: and whatever
     may be thought of the particular instance, many will feel that there
     is both piety and probability in such a mode of using the riches of
     Scripture and of Nature, mutually to illustrate and bring out each
     other ; and will see in this eager profuse way of heaping simile
     upon simile, something not unlike St. Paul's own manner of
     passing rapidly, even in the gravest arguments, from one analogy to
     another more or less connected with it : as from the seed changed in
     the ground to the difference between earthly bodies and heavenly ;
     and again, from the unequal magnitude of the stars to the inequality
     of the Saints in glory. There is no discrepancy between the tone of
     the Apostles and that of the Church in after ages, in respect of
     their both assuming, clearly and deliberately, a certain
     correspondence, intended by the Creator, between the material and
     spiritual worlds.

     (16.) Something perhaps is added to this argument by the manner in
     which our Lord's own example teaches us to take up and use
     proverbial sayings. "Lift up your eyes and look unto the fields, for
     they are white already unto the harvest;" "If they do these things
     in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?" By instructing His
     disciples to affix a divine sense, an interpretation connected with
     the things of His kingdom, to familiar household words such as
     these, He seems to sanction the idea, that there is perhaps nothing
     so low and trivial in our ordinary life, but a spiritual and
     heavenly meaning may be found for it. And further, He seems to hint
     to us, that this correspondence of things seen with unseen, is by no
     means so high and transcendental a matter, but that it may well be
     set before the minds even of very simple uneducated
     Christians---the class which is most apt to be attracted by
     proverbs, and to use them frequently.

     (17.) Another, and a yet more direct sanction appears to be afforded
     by the large use of material signs for spiritual objects and
     processes in the, inspired Mosaic Ritual. The whole of that Ritual
     served, we know, to the example and shadow of heavenly things; it
     was made and ordered according to the pattern shewed to Moses in the
     Mount. Here, therefore, were no inconsiderable number of visible
     materials, forms, and actions, concerning which the Fathers knew for
     certain that they were intended to express heavenly things---that
     their archetypes, so to speak, existed in the Mount. By reference to
     these they might prove and check, as it were, the conclusions to
     which they had come in other ways, whether by instinct, or obscure
     tradition, or examination of scriptural imagery in general,
     regarding the symbolical meaning of external objects. If they had
     been led, for example, to conjecture that certain animals---the
     lamb, the dove, the ox, the goat, and the like---were types, or
     tokens, in nature, of certain spiritual beings or truths: they would
     be confirmed in such their conjecture by the use of those animals,
     or their images, in the worship and furniture of the Tabernacle. The
     like may be said of plants---the palm, the cedar, the hyssop, and
     others; of colours, such as white, purple, and scarlet; of
     materials, linen and woollen; metals and precious stones : the use
     of any such thing in the divinely ordained ritual would give a new
     and heavenly significance to any mention of it which might occur in
     Isaiah and the Psalms, and both together would set it apart for
     ever, in the judgment of affectionate and imaginative minds, as a
     natural symbol or sacrament of something out of sight.

     (18.) The historical Scriptures too would often furnish additional
     presumptions to the same effect, by the recorded use of certain
     materials and forms,---the material of wood for instance, and the
     form of the Cross,---in God's miraculous and providential
     dealings. Indeed, so many and so clear are the correspondencies in
     this kind, that there have not been wanting ingenious writers, both
     in ancient and modern times, who have explained particular parts,
     both of the ritual and history, such as the forms of the Tabernacle
     and Temple, and the construction of the Ark, as physical allegories,
     designed to represent the system of the world, or the frame of the
     human body : theories seemingly too wild and strange to be
     maintained by men of learning and piety, but accounted for, if we
     may be allowed to suppose that both the history or ritual on the one
     hand, and the system of the world or of the body on the other, are
     separate sets of visible symbols shadowing out invisible truths.

     (19.) There is one way more, and a very obvious one, in which the
     consideration of the Ritual and History might confirm the early
     Christians in their mystical explanations of the whole external
     world. They found some particulars, both ritual and historical,
     mystically expounded in the New Testament, and plain implications,
     almost assertions, that the whole, was capable of similar
     exposition---e. g. that "Moses made all things according to the
     pattern shewed him in the Mount;" and that "all things that befel
     God's people in the wilderness happened unto them as types of
     us." When therefore in the natural world they had ascertained a few
     chief symbols, it was reasonable for them to infer that these too
     were but specimens, single chords of a harmony to be fully made out
     hereafter : they would feel like learners of a language, who have
     picked up the meaning as yet but of a few words here and there, but
     have no doubt whatever that the whole has its meaning : and perhaps
     they would think that they found warrant for this in such texts as
     that of St. Paul to the Romans, "The invisible things of Him from
     the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the
     things that are made." This would seem to lay down the principle or
     canon of mystical interpretation for the works of Nature, as the
     other texts, just now specified, for the Mosaic ceremonies and the
     history of the Jews.

     (20.) So much for the direct encouragement given in the Bible to the
     symbolical use of things natural. There is, as was mentioned above,
     another indirect yet real presumption to the same effect, which at
     present can only just be adverted to : and that is, the studied
     preference of poetical forms of thought and language, as the channel
     of supernatural knowledge to mankind. Poetry, traced as high up as
     we can go, may almost seem to be God's gift from the beginning,
     vouchsafed to us for this very purpose: at any rate the fact is
     unquestionable, that it was the ordained vehicle of revelation,
     until God Himself was made manifest in the flesh. And since the
     characteristic tendency of poetical minds is to make the world of
     sense, from beginning to end, symbolical of the absent and unseen,
     any instance of divine favour shewn to Poetry, any divine use of it
     in the training of GOD's people, would seem, as far as it goes, to
     warrant that tending to set God's seal upon it, and witness it
     as reasonable and true. Much might be said on this head : but it is
     enough now to have just indicated it, as one among the many reasons
     for thinking that Christian Antiquity was far more scriptural, than
     at first we might be apt to imagine, as in many other things, so in
     the deep mystical import, which it unreservedly attributes to the
     whole material world, and to all parts of it

                              (To be continued.)
